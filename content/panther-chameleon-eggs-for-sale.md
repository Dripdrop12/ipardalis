Buying or selling Panther Chameleon eggs is not ethical. We wrote a [blog article on the topic]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}) back in June, 2023. This is our FAQ page for Panther Chameleon eggs for sale.

{{< faq title="Can You Buy Panther Chameleon Eggs?" >}}
Yes - but selling Panther Chameleon eggs is a common scam. You should buy a healthy juvenile so you can assess the lineage and quality of your Panther Chameleon prior to your purchase. There is a reason the egg flipper wants you to buy it before it hatches, or doesn't hatch. Seller "guarantees" are just a hook to force/encourage you to buy more things from them months later. And they need to remain in business to honor the agreement - the average lifespan of a chameleon breeder is very short - not long enough for the chickens to come home to roost here.

{{< faq title="Should I Buy a Panther Chameleon Egg?" >}}
No - please support ethical breeders in the Panther Chameleon industry. Many egg sellers are notorious for poor husbandry, dishonest business practices and cutting corners whenever possible. They are selling eggs because they do not invest in proper equipment to raise the babies and they often don't know how. That means they often can't help you be successful with your baby chameleon when it hatches. Buying Panther Chameleon eggs promotes over-production and the commodification of Panther Chameleons. Don't take part in that.

{{< faq title="Do People Sell Healthy Panther Chameleons with Strong Genetics as Eggs?" >}}
No - they flip eggs that they purchase for $10-$15 each under false lineage. You won't know that you have been scammed until 18 months or more after your purchase, if you are lucky enough to get a male, and you won't know for another 3 years or more if you get a female.

{{< faq title="Can I Bond with my Baby Panther Chameleon?" >}}
No - they are extremely vulnerable and small. Any interaction with a hatchling Panther Chameleon is likely to cause severe stress and potentially result in a hunger strike. Please do not attempt to bond with a hatchling Panther Chameleon. You are very likely to kill it. You are not "bonding" with it - you are abusing it.

{{< faq title="Is There a Benefit to Having Control of Your Baby Panther Chameleon's Care from Day 1?" >}}
Unless you are an experienced breeder, no. You are more likely to make a mistake and kill your hatchling. The average buyer is not very well equipped to care for a hatchling Panther Chameleon. Reputable breeders have spent years of trial and error so they can skip the errors and improve. You don't get that luxury as a novice Panther Chameleon keeper - your errors can result in the permanent harm or death of your fragile pet. It is much better to work with an experienced breeder and work up to the care of a hatchling after successfully raising a hardy juvenile.

{{< faq title="Is Buying a Panther Chameleon Egg the only way to Spread out the Cost of Buying Supplies?" >}}
No - every reputable breeder has offered some form of pre-payment plan for decades. Suggesting this is an advantage for buying a Panther Chameleon egg is dishonest at best. We run a [Reservation Program]({{< ref "/baby-panther-chameleons-for-sale" >}}) for every clutch we have incubating. And when you get a juvenile from our program, we review your enclosure with you to ensure that it is dialed in prior to shipment. You don't have a 12 month window when you have to be ready every day for a fragile hatchling to emerge... Ready or not!

{{< faq title="How Expensive are Feeders for a Baby Panther Chameleon?" >}}
Feeder insects for baby Panther Chameleons are not cheap because the feeders often don't last very long (both fruit flies and bean beetles go through fast boom/bust cycles), and it is challenging to keep the proper sizes on hand as your baby Panther Chameleon grows. It is easy to waste multiple cultures, maybe even dozens of cultures, while you wait for your Panther Chameleon egg to hatch. When they do hatch, they can't eat an entire fruit fly culture by themselves and you are likely going to waste tens of thousands of flies on a single Panther Chameleon Hatchling. You also won't be buying those cultures in bulk. When you move up to crickets, the smallest size cricket will out grow your baby Panther Chameleon in a matter of days, so if you buy 500 1/16" crickets, you may be able to feed him 20-30 before they get too big for him/her to eat the rest. That's more than 95% waste and you will be paying retail price for those. It is very easy to spend upwards of $200-$250 on feeders alone between 0-3 months of age on a single Panther Chameleon hatchling because you will be wasting feeders compared to a breeder who can do it at around $150 across an entire clutch.

{{< faq title="How Long do Panther Chameleon Eggs Take to Hatch?" >}}
Panther Chameleon eggs hatch 6-7 months after being laid when incubated at 74 degrees Fahrenheit. Their incubation times can vary from as short as 4.5 months to up to 18 months. This highly variable incubation period is one of the reasons it is not ethical to buy or sell Panther Chameleon eggs. It is very common for people to miss the hatch date by long enough to kill or stunt the baby chameleon.

{{< faq title="How do I Know If My Panther Chameleon Egg is Fertile?" >}}
A fertile Panther Chameleon egg should hold a nice round shape with a white shell. They will grow significantly in size over the incubation period, sometimes more than doubling in weight. A fertilized Panther Chameleon egg will eventually have hairlike cracks which begin to sweat about 1 week before they hatch. An unfertilized Panther Chameleon egg can grow in size over the incubation period, but instead of sweating and hatching, they just shrivel up and mold over. This is another reason why selling Panther Chameleons is such an effective scam - infertile eggs will often go to term - and it is very common for people to wait months to find out.

{{< faq title="How to Take Care of Panther Chameleon Eggs?" >}}
We place them in a small Tupperware container using Josh's Frogs Incubation Media, and store it in a cabinet which stays around 72-74 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year. Our Tupperware have 1/16" holes punched in a ring around the top for ventilation, and we check the weight of the containers every 2 months. If necessary, we add water to keep them near 100% humidity at all times.

{{< faq title="Do Chameleons Lay Eggs?" >}}
Yes - chameleons are oviparous. Many species of chameleons dig holes and bury their eggs in sandy soil like many species of turtles. This is one characteristic which makes them very interesting pets. 
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="Why Do Many Chameleons Die After Laying Eggs?" >}}
Usually, fatal complications from egg laying are caused by husbandry mistakes such as over feeding, dehydration or lack of proper nutrition. If the laying site is inadequate, some female chameleons will die of exhaustion looking for a proper place to dig and lay her eggs. A healthy female chameleon should be able to lay her eggs without complications in a suitable location. 
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="How Many Eggs Does a Chameleon Lay?" >}}
A chameleon can lay anywhere from 10 to 60 eggs. Larger species such as Veiled Chameleons are notorious for laying dangerously large clutches when they are over fed and provided with too much heat. Smaller chameleon species such as Furcifer lateralis (Carpet Chameleons) and Furcifer minor (Lesser Chameleons) tend to have clutches in the 7 to 15 egg range. Panther Chameleons like the ones we own usually lay between 15 and 30 eggs - ideally about 20 eggs.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="How Often do Panther Chameleons Lay Eggs?" >}}
A receptive female panther chameleon will lay her eggs within 30-45 days of mating, and then lay again within 60 days of that first clutch. We call that her retained clutch. She may lay a second or third retained clutch on a similar cadence if she is healthy. When she is done with her retained clutches, she will enter another receptive cycle. 
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="Can Chameleons Lay Eggs without Mating?" >}}
Yes - most species of chameleons will lay unfertilized eggs in captivity; however, some are more likely to do so than others. The issue is exacerbated when a female chameleon is over fed or provided with high basking temperatures. This is why you need to provide every sexually mature female chameleon with adequate laying options at all times.
