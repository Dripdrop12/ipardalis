> It is very difficult to get a Panther Chameleon which perfectly matches a given phenotype/morph because their [genetics]({{< ref "blog/2022-07-23-body-color-theory" >}}) and inheritance patterns are extremely complex. These two examples are about as close as you can get to a YBBB Panther Chameleon - a little wiggle room on their bars or body but nearly impossible to get both 100%. We like to shoot for the impossible, knowing it is.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Yellow Body Blue Bar (YBBB) Ambilobe Panther Chameleons

Here are some common questions we get about YBBB Panther Chameleons.

### Why isn't it yellow?

Yellow-bodied Panther Chameleons typically rest in a vibrant green coloration. Even the Nosy Mitsio local form exhibits this trait, transitioning to a bright yellow when fully aroused. Their yellow coloration can appear during sleep, mating, or when defending territory. However, if your Panther Chameleon remains yellow continuously, it may indicate illness or dehydration. Continuous yellow coloration is a warning sign, and you should take immediate action to assess and address your chameleon's health.

### Doesn't Every Breeder Have YBBB Ambilobe?

No, trust us. We have searched extensively, and very few breeders offer high-quality yellow-bodied Ambilobe chameleons. Many have rainbow or classic Ambilobe with some yellow, but these often include reds and oranges and do not exhibit the pure yellow coloration of an iPardalis YBBB. For nearly a decade, we have selectively bred to perfect this specific phenotype within the Ambilobe local form, focusing on achieving high or clean yellow bodies.

### At What Age do They Develop Their Yellows?

Typically, a good amount of yellow can be seen by 4-5 months of age. However, red coloration may appear around 5-8 months, potentially blending with the yellow. This can also occur in reverse, with initially red-dominant chameleons developing more yellow over time. Coloration at any given time is just a snapshot, and while there are no guarantees, it is rare for an extremely yellow chameleon to lose this coloration significantly as they age.

### How do you know that Yellow isn't indicative of some Sambava or Mitsio in their lineage?

We ensure the integrity of our Ambilobe lines by tracing their lineage back over five generations. This meticulous process confirms that these chameleons have been consistently recognized as Ambilobe or are recent imports labeled as such. We have **never** intentionally crossbred our Ambilobe project, although not all founding animals were acclimated by us. We look forward to utilizing [genetic testing]({{< ref "/blog/2021-12-31-locale-test/index.md" >}}) in the future to verify their locale, continuing to breed some of the most vibrantly colored YBBB Ambilobe in the USA.
