## Frequently Asked Questions about Baby Panther Chameleons

{{< faq title="How Long do Panther Chameleon Eggs Take to Hatch?" h="h3" >}}
Panther Chameleon eggs hatch 6-7 months after being laid when incubated at 74 degrees Fahrenheit. Their incubation times can vary from as short as 4.5 months to up to 18 months. This highly variable incubation period is one of the reasons it is not ethical to buy or sell Panther Chameleon eggs. It is very common for people to miss the hatch date by long enough to kill or stunt the baby chameleon. We reach out to people on our reservation list when the eggs hatch and give them time to prepare - knowing that their hatchling chameleon is in expert hands.

{{< faq title="How fast do baby Panther Chameleons grow?" h="h3" >}} 
Baby Panther Chameleons grow very quickly from a .5 gram jelly-bean-sized hatchling to a sexually mature adult by around 8-10 months old. We weighed a clutch of babies every two weeks as they grew from 8 weeks old to 12 weeks old (roughly the age when they are ready for a new home). They started around 2.7 grams on average but just during those 4 weeks they grew to 10.6 grams on average!

{{< faq title="How big should baby Panther Chameleons be when you buy them?" h="h3" >}}
If you look at the results of our 2021 [study on the growth rates of baby panther chameleons raised under different UVI]({{< ref "/blog/baby-panther-chameleon-growth-rate/index.html" >}}), there was a decent amount of variation. The largest individual was 27.6 grams but the smallest had still not hit his exponential growth curve and he was only 1.4 grams. This is exactly why you can't just buy them at 3 months old - they also need to be at least 12 grams of weight. iPardalis uses both size and age to determine when/if a baby Panther Chameleon is ready for a new home.
