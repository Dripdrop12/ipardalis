## Frequently Asked Questions about Baby Panther Chameleons

{{< faq title="How Long do Panther Chameleon Eggs Take to Hatch?" h="h3" >}}
Panther Chameleon eggs hatch 6-7 months after being laid when incubated at 74 degrees Fahrenheit. Their incubation times can vary from as short as 4.5 months to up to 18 months. This highly variable incubation period is one of the reasons it is not ethical to buy or sell Panther Chameleon eggs. It is very common for people to miss the hatch date by long enough to kill or stunt the baby chameleon. We reach out to people on our reservation list when the eggs hatch and give them time to prepare - knowing that their hatchling chameleon is in expert hands.

{{< faq title="What do Baby Panther Chameleons eat?" h="h3" >}}
Baby Panther Chameleons primarily eat small insects such as fruit flies, pinhead crickets, bean beetles, silkworms and small Dubia roaches. It’s important to provide a varied diet and dust the insects with calcium and vitamin supplements to ensure proper nutrition during this critical phase in their lives.

We found, in 2018, that it is advantageous to house hatchlings in bio-active tubs because their food items are small - and would escape screen enclosures - and some hatchlings like to tuck under the leaves near the soil (ABG mix) while digesting their remaining yolk. The goal at this stage is to provide tons of food options, springtails, isopods, fruit flies, flour beetle larvae, bean beetles, silk worms, etc. When there is an abundance of food, the little ones thrive. We measure the UVB at the highest point and shoot for 2.5 - 3. Ambient temps in the mid 70s and basking in the low 80s. Since, 2020 or so, we have been housing our hatchlings in individual bioactive environments and, in 2022-2023, we invested in an advanced condo system from [Tamura Designs](https://tamura-designs.com/collections/condos/products/6-condo-clear-front-nursery).

At about 4-6 weeks of age, we often move them into sterile [Dragon Strand](https://dragonstrand.com/) Nursery cages. This helps them develop faster and thrive post-shipment because we can closely monitor their health. UVB and heat are similar to hatchlings, but we add halogen puck lights to provide a bit more heat at this time. Feeding them at this age is a huge challenge. Some are a bit smaller and still prefer small prey, so you can't start feeding larger prey items to every one. You have to monitor their daily food consumption and figure out what they like to eat. Then, give them as much as they will eat in a single day, every day.

{{< faq title="How do I care for a Baby Panther Chameleon from iPardalis?" h="h3" >}}
Caring for a baby Panther Chameleon involves setting up a proper habitat with adequate lighting, humidity, and temperature control. Their diet should consist of appropriately sized insects, supplemented with calcium and vitamins. Regular misting and a well-ventilated enclosure are also essential to maintain the health of your chameleon baby. We recommend reading [what do I need for a hatchling Panther Chameleon?](https://chameleonacademy.com/what-do-i-need-for-a-hatchling-panther-chameleon/) for a detailed guide from the industry's most experienced chameleon keeper, Bill Strand.

{{< faq title="Why Should I buy a baby Panther Chameleon?" h="h3" >}}
We personally enjoy watching their colors develop as they grow, so buying a baby Panther Chameleon is the best way to experience this for yourself. It may also be your only opportunity to steal away one of those once in a lifetime specimens which we would never sell if we knew what we had produced. Panther Chameleons are notorious for their color development and changes and a healthy baby is the most affordable and one of the more enjoyable ways to buy into the hobby.

{{< faq title="How fast do baby Panther Chameleons grow?" h="h3" >}} 
Baby Panther Chameleons grow very quickly from a .5 gram jelly-bean-sized hatchling to a sexually mature adult by around 8-10 months old. We weighed a clutch of babies every two weeks as they grew from 8 weeks old to 12 weeks old (roughly the age when they are ready for a new home). They started around 2.7 grams on average but just during those 4 weeks they grew to 10.6 grams on average!

{{< faq title="How big should baby Panther Chameleons be when you buy them?" h="h3" >}}
If you look at the results of our 2021 [study on the growth rates of baby panther chameleons raised under different UVI]({{< ref "/blog/baby-panther-chameleon-growth-rate/index.html" >}}), there was a decent amount of variation. The largest individual was 27.6 grams but the smallest had still not hit his exponential growth curve and he was only 1.4 grams. This is exactly why you can't just buy them at 3 months old - they also need to be at least 12 grams of weight. iPardalis uses both size and age to determine when/if a baby Panther Chameleon is ready for a new home.

## Chameleon Eggs vs Baby Chameleons
{{< faq title="What should I expect when hatching chameleon eggs?" h="h3" >}}
When hatching chameleon eggs, you’ll notice the eggs start to “sweat” or develop condensation as they near the hatching stage. The baby chameleon will begin to pip, creating small slits in the eggshell, and emerge fully within a few hours to a day. Ensure the hatching environment is safe and suitable. A small hatchling, unlike one of our baby/juvenile chameleons, will not tolerate any mistakes.

{{< faq title="Where can I find panther chameleon eggs for sale?" h="h3" >}}
Panther Chameleon eggs can be found for sale through egg flippers and scam artists. Please ensure that the seller is blacklisted at local and regional reptile expos. You should not support this unethical practice, and it would be very helpful if you ensure that they do not have a platform to threaten our industry with their gimmick.
