# Retired

## Kako
Sire
: [Sparkles]({{< ref "/breeders/lineage.md#sparkles" >}})

Dam Sire
: [Leo]({{< ref "/breeders/lineage.md#leo" >}})

Kako was a very striking female with a shy personality. She was taken by a hawk from our garden fence...

## Flash
Sire
: [Cowboy]({{< ref "/breeders/lineage.md#cowboy" >}})

Dam Sire
: [Jake]({{< ref "/breeders/lineage.md#jake" >}})

The Sire to our first clutch and such a gentle boy! Absolutely one of our favorites.
