{{< faq title="What is a chameleon feeder cup?" >}}
A chameleon feeder cup is a specially designed container used to hold live insects for chameleons. These cups keep insects from escaping and help chameleons access their food more easily as they move up and down the back of the feeder run.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="Why should I use a feeder cup for my chameleon?" >}}
Feeder cups help you track your chameleon's diet by preventing insects from hiding in the enclosure. If they don't get eaten, you can see them in the cup. They also reduce the risk of your chameleon ingesting substrate, which can cause health issues. Or the risk that your feeder eats your chameleon's poop and becomes an even bigger health risk, especially if your chameleon has [parasites]({{< ref "/blog/parasites_and_ethics.md" >}}). Some feeders, like Dubia roaches, can easily hide from your chameleon if you don't tong feed or use a feeder cup.

{{< faq title="What types of feeder cups are available?" >}}
Feeder cups come in various designs, including magnetic, suction-based, and those designed to look like natural elements. For example, [Full Throttle Feeders](https://www.fullthrottlefeeders.com/) offers camo-themed feeder cups with magnet mounts, while [Sunset Chameleons](https://sunsetchameleons.com/) features hand-carved log-style feeders. There are some cheap ones which attach to the screen of your chameleon's enclosure, but many keepers are moving away from screen cages and, as anyone who has cleaned cricket poop off screen cages, the maintenance is not worth the $10 you save on these cheap cups.

{{< faq title="How do I install a feeder cup in my chameleon’s enclosure?" >}}
Installation varies by design. Magnetic feeder cups can be attached to mesh enclosures easily, while some also come with metal disks for smooth surfaces. Some models, like those from [Full Throttle Feeders](https://www.fullthrottlefeeders.com/), offer additional attachments for various surfaces such as PVC or glass.

{{< faq title="What types of insects can I use in a feeder cup?" >}}
Feeder cups can hold a variety of live insects such as crickets, mealworms, superworms, and dubia roaches. Give crickets a chance to calm down before you pour them in so they don't jump out immediately. Dubia and superworms are perfect feeders in cups because they tend the crawl along the back and don't climb out.

{{< faq title="How often should I clean the feeder cup?" >}}
Clean the feeder cup weekly to prevent mold and bacteria buildup. Use warm water and mild soap, ensuring all soap residue is thoroughly rinsed off. [Sunset Chameleons](https://sunsetchameleons.com/) has detachable bottoms which make it easy to pop it off and clean it without removing the whole unit.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="Can I leave the feeder cup in the enclosure all the time?" >}}
Yes, but it should be cleaned regularly. Remove any uneaten insects daily to maintain a healthy environment for your chameleon. I sometimes put a carrot or mango slice in the cup so that my chameleons can eat freshly gut loaded insects :smiley:.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="What if my chameleon doesn’t eat from the feeder cup?" >}}
Try different positions within the enclosure to make the cup more accessible. Ensure the cup is placed in a well-lit area where your chameleon can easily see it. Sometimes, you just have to be patient while your chameleon becomes familiar with his/her new cup. Or you can try a novel item like a grasshopper from [Feed my Chameleon](https://feedmychameleon.com/) or a stick bug from [Full Throttle Feeders](https://www.fullthrottlefeeders.com/) to peak their interest. Keep trying and they'll figure it out!
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq title="Are there any safety concerns with using feeder cups?" >}}
Ensure the feeder cup is securely mounted to prevent it from falling. Regular cleaning is essential to avoid bacterial growth. Check the cup for sharp edges that could harm your chameleon. Many DIY solutions leave sharp edges which can decapitate their delicate [tongues]({{< ref "/how-long-is-a-chameleons-tongue.md" >}}) - I know I am safe with Nick and Jim's work and whatever I could save in upfront cost I would lose in future maintenance and heartbreak.

{{< faq title="How do Full Throttle Feeders and Sunset Chameleons feeder cups compare?" >}}
**Full Throttle Feeders**: Offers a variety of sizes and designs including tree bark and camo patterns. Their cups feature screened bottoms for drainage and come with magnets for easy mounting. Nick Barta has been building the most affordable, sturdy Chameleon Feeder Cups in the industry for decades. I got my first cup from him, and I still use it to this day. 

**Sunset Chameleons**: Known for their “Log Lunch” feeders which are hand-carved and painted to resemble natural logs, are an aesthetically pleasing option. These are available in multiple sizes and colors to suit different preferences. Jim Rykbost got started as a chameleon breeder about the same time that I did, and he has done some amazing work with pardalis. He is an artist and he really enjoys customer ideas and feedback. Let him know what you want and he'll carve it!

Both brands provide durable, reptile-safe feeder cups designed to enhance the feeding experience for your chameleon. Choose based on your aesthetic preference and the specific needs of your enclosure setup. Jim and Nick are both innovators, so I am sure my article will be out of date as soon as I hit publish. Get in touch with them to find out what they're up to and how they can help you feed your chameleon properly.
