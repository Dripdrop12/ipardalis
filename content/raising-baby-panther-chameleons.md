Before our Panther Chameleon breeding project started in 2015, most of the Panther Chameleon industry housed their hatchlings and juveniles in groups, large and small, where they had to fight for survival in an unnaturally competitive space. In the wild, hatchlings quickly disperse into their own micro-habitats. They are solitary animals from day 1. They prefer to communicate at a distance with some of nature's most beautiful courtship and threat displays; however, when they cannot flee or show submissiveness in a small space, dominant animals will try to kill animals in their territory (male and female). Baby Panther Chameleons are not strong enough to follow through with their intention, but it is clear nonetheless! 

Individually-raising has been a win-win shift for Panther Chameleons and keepers alike. Without the stress, disease and battle scarring that comes with group-raising, they are hearty, healthy, more colorful, larger and do not have any baggage due to [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) (It is a huge red flag if someone uses the term "friendly" to describe their group-raised chameleons). Our goal is to provide environments and stimuli which encourage natural behavior, including defensive and courtship displays, helping them feel safe around their human caregiver, and reducing their stress by training them to cooperate in their own care regimen.
