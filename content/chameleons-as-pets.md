{{< faq title="Are Panther Chameleons friendly?" h="h3" >}}
No - they are solitary animals which should always be housed individually. They prefer to be left alone. Panther Chameleons are not aggressive, but some can be territorial and defensive, especially if you move quickly in their personal space. They do not like to be handled - you should always provide them with options to escape and hide if they prefer. Limit interactions until they view you as a source of food and comfort. Don't rush it.

{{< faq title="How do you build trust with your Panther Chameleon?" h="h3" >}}
You can gain their trust, but it should be done slowly, on their terms. We are huge fans of [Choice-based handling](https://journal.iaabcfoundation.org/choice-control-and-training-for-ectotherms/) techniques focused on their choices, sense of control and natural behavior - not our perception of their demeanor. This can often be achieved through patient hand feeding exercises.

{{< faq title="Should You Keep a Panther Chameleon as a Pet?" h="h3" >}}
I believe Panther Chameleons make wonderful pets. They teach us to respect nature and love it unconditionally. You provide safety, security and care without expecting anything in return - just like we should do with the forest, rivers, lakes and ocean. We may get lucky now and then, but the lesson is very valuable. Especially in today's world where we often expect immediate gratification and are surrounded by short, transactional relationships.

{{< faq title="Why are Panther Chameleons often considered difficult to care for?" h="h3" >}}
Creating a thriving environment for Panther Chameleons involves replicating their arboreal habitat with misting systems, live plants, and high humidity at night. While specific husbandry conditions are crucial, many aspects can be automated with timers and suitable equipment. With the right setup, chameleon care becomes manageable, and they can adapt well to captivity. Interestingly, the challenge often lies more in managing their diet, with crickets requiring more attention and care than the overall maintenance of the chameleon's habitat.

{{< faq title="What is the easiest chameleon to care for?" h="h3" >}}
Veiled Chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) and Panther Chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) are widely regarded as two of the easiest chameleons to care for. Veiled Chameleons, originating from Yemen and Saudi Arabia, are known for their adaptability and hardiness. Panther Chameleons, native to Madagascar, exhibit vibrant colors and are relatively more tolerant of handling. Both species have manageable care requirements, making them suitable choices for chameleon enthusiasts, especially those new to reptile keeping.

{{< faq title="How do you take care of a panther chameleon for beginners?" h="h3" >}}
For beginners caring for a Panther Chameleon (Furcifer pardalis), focus on essentials like a well-ventilated enclosure with live plants for climbing. Maintain a temperature range of 70-80°F, with a basking spot at 85°F during the day and a drop at night down to below 70°F. Provide UVB lighting (Arcadia T5 6%, Leap Habitats or Reptisun 5.0), ensuring a 12-hour light cycle. Maintain humidity levels between 40-60% during the day, misting the enclosure at least twice daily. Feed a varied diet of gut-loaded insects (our two favorites are [Feeder Fuel](https://readysrainforest.com/products/feeder-fuel-1-pound-bag) and [Cricket Crack](https://www.fullthrottlefeeders.com/gutloads-and-supplies)), supplemented with calcium every feeding and multivitamins twice a month. Regularly monitor your chameleon's health, behavior, and feces. Seek a vet experienced in reptile care for periodic check-ups to ensure their well-being.
