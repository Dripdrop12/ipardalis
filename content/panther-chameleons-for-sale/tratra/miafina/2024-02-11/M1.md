description: 6 Month-old Rainbow Panther Chameleon from Tratra and Miafina. True F1 Panther Chameleon. However, it looks like Miafina was mislabeled and was actually a WC Ambanja, so these are likely 50/50 Ambilobe x Ambanja crosses. The teals on his legs and spine and the vibrant reds in his bars as well as his rostrum are tell-tale Ambanja traits. We've included sire and dam dendrograms if available, but you can view our Tratra or Miafina breeder pages for more information.
