iPardalis (individually-raised pardalis) is an Ambilobe Panther Chameleon breeding company founded in 2015 with the goal of proving that ethical rearing practices of Furcifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons) can be profitable. We are proud to have been there on the ground pushing for this shift in the industry, after listening to Bill Strand's [Chameleon Academy Podcast](https://chameleonacademy.com/podcasts/), and things have come a long way since then. 

[Why should you individually-raise Panther Chameleons?]({{< ref "/raising-baby-panther-chameleons.md" >}})

Individually-raised Panther Chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) are some of the most brilliant, colorful animals from Madagascar. Panther Chameleons are a good beginning species of chameleon, which can open a whole new chapter in your life with nature. Searching for a reptile with a rainbow hue? You've come to the right location.

We specialize in yellow body blue bar (YBBB) Ambilobe Panther Chameleons. Our female YBBB Ambilobe are highly coveted as founding stock animals in the industry due to their vibrant color, robustness, and trustworthy lineage. Despite the lower market value of female panther chameleons often leading to inadequate rearing, we ensure our females receive the same level of care as our hold back males.

We only sell Panther Chameleons that are bred in captivity and are over 12 grams in weight. We do not sell hatchlings, babies, [eggs]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}), or wild-caught animals. Every iPardalis Panther Chameleon has a [life-long guarantee]({{< ref "tos.md" >}}). 

Whatever issue you encounter, even years later, we want to be part of the solution. We talk to customers every day, helping with medical emergencies and answering questions about caring for chameleons and husbandry choices. We pride ourselves on knowing where our chameleons go and helping ensure they live to their fullest potential.
