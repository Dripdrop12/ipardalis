iPardalis (individually-raised pardalis) is an Ambilobe Panther Chameleon breeding company founded in 2015 with the goal of proving that ethical rearing practices of Furcifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons) can be profitable. We are proud to have been there on the ground pushing for this shift in the industry, after listening to Bill Strand's [Chameleon Academy Podcast](https://chameleonacademy.com/podcasts/), and things have come a long way since then. [Why should you individually-raise Panther Chameleons?]({{< ref "/raising-baby-panther-chameleons.md" >}}) Individually-raised Panther Chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) are some of the most brilliant, colorful animals from Madagascar. Panther Chameleons are a good beginning species of chameleon, which can open a whole new chapter in your life with nature. If a rainbow-colored reptile you are looking for, you are in the right place!

We specialize in yellow body blue bar (YBBB) Ambilobe Panther Chameleons. Our female YBBB are some of the most sought after founding stock animals in the industry because of their color, vigor and reliable pedigree. It is also very rare for females to be raised properly given their lower market value, but we raise our females just like our hold back males. 

Our Panther Chameleons for sale are exclusively captive bred juveniles - we do not sell hatchlings, babies, [eggs]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}), or wild caught animals - we only sell juveniles over 12 grams of weight, regardless of their age. Every iPardalis Panther Chameleon has a [life-long guarantee]({{< ref "tos.md" >}}). Whatever issue you encounter, even years later, we want to be part of the solution. We are in touch with our customers, daily, jumping on the phone in emergency medical consultations and answering basic questions about husbandry and reptile products. We pride ourselves on knowing where our chameleons go and helping ensure they live to their fullest potential.
