iPardalis (individually-raised pardalis) is an Ambilobe Panther Chameleon breeding company founded in 2015 with the goal of proving that ethical rearing practices of Furcifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons) can be profitable. We are proud to have been there on the ground pushing for this shift in the industry, after listening to Bill Strand's [Chameleon Academy Podcast](https://chameleonacademy.com/podcasts/), and things have come a long way since then. [Why should you individually-raise Panther Chameleons?]({{< ref "/raising-baby-panther-chameleons.md" >}}) Individually-raised Furcifer pardalis are some of the most brilliant, multicolored animals from Madagascar available to hobbyists in the United States. If that is what you are looking for, you are in the right place!

Our Panther Chameleons for sale are exclusively juveniles or older - we do not sell hatchlings, babies or [eggs]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}) (click that link for details on why we are opposed to the sale of chameleon eggs) - we only sell juveniles over 12 grams of weight, regardless of their age. Every iPardalis Panther Chameleon has a [life-long guarantee]({{< ref "tos.md" >}}). Whatever issue you encounter, even years later, we want to be part of the solution. We are in touch with our customers, daily, jumping on the phone in emergency medical consultations and answering basic questions about husbandry and reptile products. We pride ourselves on knowing where our chameleons go and helping ensure they live to their fullest potential. 

Check out our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jonmarkhill) page or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ipardalis/) account for regular updates on our project, and our [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}) has research on [Panther Chameleon genetics]({{< ref "/categories/genetics" >}}), opinion pieces on [ethics]({{< ref "/categories/ethics" >}}), photography of thousands of Panther Chameleons, [podcasts]({{< ref "/categories/podcasts" >}}), [husbandry]({{< ref "/categories/husbandry" >}}) and more!
