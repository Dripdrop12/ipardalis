Imported by [One World Exotica](https://www.instagram.com/oneworldexotica/) in June 2022.

Dia was our favorite wild-caught Ambilobe Panther Chameleon import. Between him and Bibi, he had a clean yellow body and his bars showed more blue as he settled in; however, he did not fully acclimate and we only got a few clutches from him. We did find him some top notch females from our line, so hopefully those great traits get worked into the gene pool!
