Imported by [One World Exotica](https://www.instagram.com/oneworldexotica/) in October 2024.

Bluey was the Wild-caught Ambanja that encouraged me to jump into a new project. I saw his nice blue bars and teal body color when he was imported in 2024, and I had a group of captive-hatched animals, including [Bingo]({{< ref "/blog/bingo/index.md" >}}), that were proving out to be Ambanja. So instead of wasting all those possibly pure Ambanja females, I decided to grab Bluey and prove them out. If I hit on pure combinations, they will produce some of the nation's best Ambanja locality animals - joining the efforts of top Ambanja breeders, like Ready's Rainforest.
