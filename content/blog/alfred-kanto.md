This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Alfred]({{< ref "/blog/alfred/index.md" >}}), and our female from Frank Payne, [Kanto]({{< ref "/blog/kanto/index.md" >}}), from [Living Art by Frank Payne]({{< ref "blog/livingart.md" >}}). Kanto comes from some great OBBB/RBBB lines from Canvas Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Alfred is the male with the most red from our Jude x Alla clutch. We kept [Ralph]({{< ref "/blog/ralph/index.md" >}}) from this group and he is a wonderful RBBB!
