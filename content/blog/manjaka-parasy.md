This pairing was between our female from [Jack]({{< ref "/blog/Nugget/index.md" >}}) x [Mavokely]({{< ref "/blog/mavokely/index.md" >}}), and our male from Colorado Chameleons, [F1 Manjaka]({{< ref "/blog/manjaka/index.md" >}}). Manjaka was pretty unassuming as a juvenile, but he became one of our favorite YBBB Ambilobe breeders as an adult. He had an extra blue bar, and yellows were classic Ambilobe. Mavokely came to us from Bobby Ruddock and she brings some of my favorite YBBB Ambilobe genetics - Amarillo.
