This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Nugget]({{< ref "/blog/nugget/index.md" >}}), and our gorgeous Ambilobe female from Chromatic Chameleons, [Loko]({{< ref "/blog/loko/index.md" >}}). Loko is from a great pairing between Kromatisk and Wet Dream - a ybbb x ybbb Ambilobe combination. Nugget is the HB male from our Jude x Kako clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the third generation. This was a great combination with our favorite third gen yellow male with an extremely high quality yellow female! [Zandrin]({{< ref "/blog/zandrin/index.md" >}}) is our keeper from this group.
