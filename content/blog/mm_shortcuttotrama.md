Ryan and Mitch are two breeders who I have a long history with. We met on social media when I got started in the hobby in 2015-2016. We have had late-night discussions on all sorts of drama, challenges, and much needed breeder therapy sessions. Mitch was a major sponsor of the panther chameleon local form genetic test. He creates some crazy cool cross-locale and pure locale panther chameleons, and Ryan started a podcast recently but I knew him from his Cap Est project - which is to-date the best I have seen.

We decided to pull up and have a discussion about egg sales here.

- Why you cannot sex a chameleon egg
- Complications from shipping and raising shipped eggs
- We struggled to come up with any pros before getting into the meat of the discussion
