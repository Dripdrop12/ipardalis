Beautiful female that we picked up from [Kevin Stanford]({{< ref "blog/kevinstanford.md" >}}). She has a really nice pitch-black body with a fire tip on the top of her yellow streaks. Stunning specimen of this species! We were able to get a few healthy clutches from her and hope to produce our first clutch from them. She has been very fun to work with thus far.
