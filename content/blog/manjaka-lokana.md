This pairing was between our F1 sire from Colorado Chameleons, [Manjaka]({{< ref "/blog/manjaka/index.md" >}}), and our female from Chromatic Chameleons, [Lokana]({{< ref "/blog/lokana/index.md" >}}). Lokana is a mix of Chromatic and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Manjaka is a wonderful YBBB from a recent import, WC Arlo. The outcomes have been extremely consiste YBBB thus far which are not directly related to our main line of Ambilobe. They are a great option for people looking for high quality pairings with our multi-generational lines.
