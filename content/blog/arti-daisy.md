This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Daisy]({{< ref "/blog/daisy/index.md" >}}), and our male from Brian Stewart, [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}). Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Daisy is a great female from our Jude x Kako clutch. Some of my favorite yellows came from this pairing and Daisy didn't disappoint ;)
