This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Jack]({{< ref "/blog/jack/index.md" >}}), and our female from [Bobby Ruddock]({{< ref "blog/bobbyruddock.md" >}}), [Mavokely]({{< ref "/blog/mavokely/index.md" >}}). Jack had some of the nicest yellows from [Jude x Alla]({{< ref "blog/jude-alla.md" >}}) and Bobby's boy [Amarillo]({{< ref "blog/bobbyruddock.md#amarillo" >}}) is one of my favorite ybbb of all time. These guys should be very special.
