Tratra is a classic wild caught (WC) Ambilobe panther chameleon. Tratra translates to "caught" in Malagasy, which complements our other two WC Bibi and WC Dia because bibidia translates to "wild" in Malagasy. After we failed to fully acclimate Dia, we decided to try again with Tratra. He has beautiful baby blue bars like our first CB holdback, Jude, and a nice consistent green body color. He fires up with a yellow/orange color which is almost gold. We are hoping to create a true F1 line with him unrelated to anything in the USA!
