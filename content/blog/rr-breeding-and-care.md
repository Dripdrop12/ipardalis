We have been reading the Reptiles Magazine for over 30 years, so it was a bucket list achievement to finally get an opportunity to contribute an article to their illustrious list of care guides and herpetoculture content. It is a broad overview of breeding and keeping the species in captivity designed for a general audience. Many of our blog articles here on ipardalis.com tend to be a bit more specific and technical. So it may be a great place to start if you are just getting started or curious about the species.
