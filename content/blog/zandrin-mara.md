{{< load-photoswipe >}}

This pairing was between our female [Mara]({{< ref "/blog/mara/index.md" >}}) from Chi-town Chameleons, and our 4th gen male, [Zandrin]({{< ref "/blog/zandrin/index.md" >}}). Zandrin was our favorite YBBB from Nugget and Mara brings the WC Legion line into our project via Nova. If we can get a HB that looks remotely similar to Zandrin x Nova, we will be super excited about this line :)
