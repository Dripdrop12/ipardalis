This pairing was between our forth generation hold back, [Ralph]({{< ref "/blog/ralph/index.md" >}}), and our female from Nature's Van Gogh, [Mainty]({{< ref "/blog/mainty/index.md" >}}). Mainty has a few rainbow brothers and a few RBBB brothers, so it will be fun to see which side she brings here. We paired Mainty with Kosmo after she had an infertile clutch after Ralph. We will probably not keep any of these wonderful animals because of our long-term plans for Mainty.
