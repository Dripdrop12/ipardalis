## [Charles Yamaguchi](https://www.chameleonforums.com/media/albums/ambilobe-panthers-charles-yamaguchi.6126/)

Charles Yamaguchi isn't a real person. Elizabeth Lawrence scammed people under this persona selling a bunch of Ambilobe x Nosy Be crosses to people. Her other aliases include: Cami Garden Hat, April Wilcox, Trevor Neufeld, and April Michelle. I would never add a female from this lineage, but I found a great looking male that's a few gens removed from her scam. So the male has proven out, but I will definitely want to run a locale genetic test to confirm the locale of these.
