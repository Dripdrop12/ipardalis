This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Tigravavy]({{< ref "/blog/tigravavy/index.md" >}}), and our male from Brian Stewart, [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}). Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Tigravavy is a stunning female from our Jude x Alla clutch. We were very happy with these guys!
