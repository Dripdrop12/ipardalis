Imported by [One World Exotica](https://www.instagram.com/oneworldexotica/) in October 2023.

WC Taiyang and WC Haiyang are two of my favorite wild caught imports; Taiyang means sun in Chinese because he has a ton of yellow w/ a little mix of orange like the sun, and Haiyang means sea/ocean in Chinese. Haiyang's blue bars are really something for a WC, so we have the sun (Taiyang) and the sea (Haiyang). They both came in great condition, and I hope to be working with them for years to come. We will probably use them to extend our 5th and 6th generation lines in ways that enable our 7th-9th gen combos.
