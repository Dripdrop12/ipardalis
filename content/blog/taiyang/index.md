Imported by [One World Exotica](https://www.instagram.com/oneworldexotica/) in October 2023.

WC Taiyang and WC Haiyang are two of my favorite wild caught imports; Taiyang means sun in Chinese because he has a ton of yellow w/ a little mix of orange like the sun, and Haiyang means sea/ocean in Chinese. Haiyang's blue bars are really something for a WC, so we have the sun (Haiyang) and the sea (Taiyang). They both came in great condition and I imagine we will be working with them and their offspring for years - famous last words. Jinx!
