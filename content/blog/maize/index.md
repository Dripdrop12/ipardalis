Maize is a great YBBB Ambilobe female from our good friend Brian Stewart. McNulty is a male from one of Brian's old projects from the Stryfe line and he paired him up with a female from one of his recent pairings with Artemis from Colorado Chameleons. These should be a lot of fun to prove out because they have three ybbb sires in the closest lineage. Top notch stuff as always!
