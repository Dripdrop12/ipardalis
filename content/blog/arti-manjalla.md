{{< load-photoswipe >}}

This pairing was between one of our F1 females from Colorado Chameleon, [Manjalla]({{< ref "/blog/manjalla/index.md" >}}), and our male from Brian Stewart, [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}). They both come from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations. The clutch was small and Manjalla was very weak, so we were only able to keep one baby alive from this group.
