This pairing was between our fourth generation hold back, [Papafee]({{< ref "/blog/papafee/index.md" >}}), and our little Ambilobe female from Ramblin' Exotics, [Coco]({{< ref "/blog/coco/index.md" >}}). Coco is from a great pairing between Hendrix and Foxey. Hendrix brings a new WC Ambilobe line into the project and Foxey is from one of my favorite ybbb combinations from Kammerflage Kreations. Papafee is the HB male from our Zanaka x Sunny clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the fourth generation. This was a great combination with our favorite fourth gen yellow male with an extremely high quality yellow female (there may be a theme here)!
