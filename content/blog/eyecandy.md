Jake Dynnis is a meticulous Panther Chameleon breeder who has been focused on the Ambilobe and Ambanja locales. Her blurple lines are probably the most well known Eye Candy Chameleons projects, but we have lineage from her work with RBBB Ambilobe. Her sire, DynamiteTNT, produced by Kaz Kameleons, was one of the most popular RBBB in 2020 or so and we worked his genetics into a few females we used in our RBBB Ambilobe project.

If you have any questions about husbandry, genetics or breeding, I highly recommend you reach out to Eye Candy Chameleons. Jake often talks for hours with customers and fellow breeders about various ideas she has and readily shares her experience. Ignore the blurple drama and just get in touch with people 1:1. We all just love chameleons at the end of the day. Jake clearly cares about her animals and is extremely knowledgeable. I hope her RBBB project takes off because she has some great stuff!
