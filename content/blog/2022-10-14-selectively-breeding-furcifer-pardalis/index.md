## Introduction

Given that Panther Chameleon (Furcifer pardalis) colors are polymorphic traits, and they are a sexually dimorphic species, selective breeding for a given color is challenging and many people fail to achieve a consistent result. If you are not familiar with what a polymorphic trait is, you should probably start by reading our previous genetics post about our [Furcifer pardalis Body Color Inheritance Theory]({{< ref "blog/2022-07-23-body-color-theory" >}}). Polymorphic traits do not have discrete results, and they produce a distribution of results with a mean roughly situated between the sire (father) and dam (mother). However, when breeding for male color, dams have to be estimated using their male ancestors before they have been bred and using their male offspring after they have been bred. We can just look at the sire to see what traits he carries, so there is basically no uncertainty there. He is what he is.

Most breeders do not understand Panther Chameleon genetics and cannot be expected to produce a given phenotype such as yellow body blue bar or red body blue bar. Many will even throw their hands up and say "you can't know." We learn more about Panther Chameleon genetics with every pairing and share that information in blog posts and photo galleries. Hopefully, that provides a better grounding for what we do and don't know, and it enables our customers to make informed decisions.

## Base Estimate

The first challenge with the base estimate for any pairing is being able to identify traits in male Panther Chameleons. Just like being able to see whether a Ball Python has Pastel, Yellow-Belly, or Enchi, we need to be able to observe the traits in male Panther Chameleons to have an accurate base estimate for what traits they carry. Without this skill, nothing else matters.

Many people do not see dirty colors - if they see some yellow, somewhere, anywhere... "it is yellow!" However, we need to look for **every** color that is present. Red between the scales at the dermal layer can bleed up to the top layer in the offspring. Red rain mixed with yellow can become more red over time or in the next generation. Gold/orange is not the same as neon yellow. Many people try to jam every animal into yellow-body blue-bar (ybbb), red-body blue-bar (rbbb) or yellow-body red-bar (ybrb) when very few animals actually fit in those extreme phenotypes and the vast majority lie somewhere in the middle. However, these extreme phenotypes are used to describe base estimates, poorly. Many people describe Ambilobe as either yellow body or red body when 95% of them are green or orange bodied, not red or yellow.

iPardalis always publishes lineage collages which represent 87.5% of the base distribution of each pairing accurately. We share the sire, dam sire, and dam's dam sire in a collage like this:

As you work your way through the dam's lineage, you gain information about her traits, but you can never know what she carries with 100% confidence. You can look at her brothers for clues, but unless you have a large enough sample to get some sense for the mean result, you are probably just cherry picking the best brother, which is not an accurate estimate for her. That is much more likely to be a rare event than an accurate representation of her traits.

| Lineage Pic                | Information Gain |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Sire                   | 50%              |
| Dam's Sire             | 25%              |
| Dam's Dam's Sire       | 12.5%            |
| Dam's Dam's Dam's Sire | 6.25%            |

This table shows roughly how much information you gain from each key male relative in a lineage tree. Notice - sire's sire is not here because he would provide a 0% information gain. Every trait from the sire's lineage is visible in him, or the trait isn't there. Looking at the sire's sire is completely useless information. It is only helpful in determining which pairings you want to do from a genetic distance/diversity standpoint, but it is irrelevant for selective breeding purposes.

## Updating Your Estimate

Before a female has been bred, her lineage is all you have to estimate her color traits. However, after her first clutch, you can use her male offspring to update your original estimate and prove her out. The more male offspring she produces, the less relevant her lineage is. Somewhere around 10 male offspring is enough to get a decent estimate for her traits, and thus, her daughters' traits. If her male offspring range from dark red bodies to bright yellow bodies, you can't know what is in her daughters. It doesn't matter if she came from yellow-bodied lineage. That result would mean that the next gen of females is completely unknown.

In our project, we do not use females from pairings which have too much variation in body color. We want to see either yellow or red bodies but not both. Any pairings where we have seen less consistency, we will drop *all* of the females and only use males with our desired traits. That eliminates the uncertainty and allows us to continue to produce consistent body colors, whether they be red or yellow.

This updating process is why we publish all of the male offspring from [every clutch](https://ipardalis.com/categories/past-clutches/) we produce, not just a few flashy hold-backs. The entire distribution and the consistent result is more important than that one-off male at the tail end of the distribution. Quality females are all about the mean of the distribution, not the 1 in 1000 result.

When we hit on a very consistent clutch like [Jude x Kako](https://ipardalis.com/blog/2019/06/05/jude-kako/), we will keep and breed as many females as we can because we know those females are going to be just as consistent as their brothers.

## Genetic Diversity

Sometimes we will pair a less-than-perfect male to a female we have a high degree of confidence in. We only do this in order to add genetic diversity into the project and know we will not keep *any* females from these pairings. The goal is just to mine out a nice male from the female's lineage and avoid males that look like the sire. I have sometimes pejoratively referred to these as "throw-away" clutches because the only goal is to introduce genetic diversity while knowing we will not be able to use any of the females for fear that they resemble their sire.

The key with this process is to make sure the sire isn't too far removed from our project goals because the chance that you will hit on a yellow body blue bar with a red body red bar sire, for example, is basically zero even if the female has solid yellow body blue bar lineage. The sire of a throw away can't be too far off, otherwise, it could end of being a 100% throw-away clutch without any males worth keeping.

## Retained Sperm

A final complication in estimating the outcome from a pairing is even knowing the sire - the most important piece of information by far (as we showed in the information gain table above). Many breeders pair multiple sires to the same dam. However, dams can retain sperm for up to 5 clutches, 18 months after the initial pairing to one sire. If she has laid 2 clutches and is then paired to different sire, she could lay 3 clutches with completely unknown lineage. Breeders will report the wrong lineage with certainty while some of those "odd ball" results are actually just coming from the first sire. Layer this onto the fact that people aren't capable of identifying traits' presence or absence in their males, and we could have a very poor estimate for what will come from a given pairing.

At iPardalis, we like to see more than 50% infertility before pairing a female to another male. We also try to make sure subsequent pairings to the same female are from closely related males so a retained-sperm baby would be very close to the stated lineage. Many breeders do life-long pairings between one male and one female which is the gold standard for avoiding this mistake.
