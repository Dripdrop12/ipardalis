Tana is a gorgeous female Ambilobe Panther Chameleon with nice purples and a body structure which reminds me of Manga and Jimanga. Her dam, Kintana, had a lot more orange so we selected for the purples which originated back in our 2019 female named Patch. We're very excited to see the YBBB potential in her - she has an amazing pedigree!x
