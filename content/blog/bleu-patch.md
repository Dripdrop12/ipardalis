This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Patch]({{< ref "/blog/patch/index.md" >}}), and our male from Jeremy Booker, [Bleu]({{< ref "/blog/bleu/index.md" >}}), from [Brightside Chameleons]({{< ref "blog/brightside.md" >}}). Bleu is the only male with Stryfe in him and we are excited to see what that brings to the project.
