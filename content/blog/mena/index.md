Mena is our HB from Zava and F1 Manjaya. Zava had a significant amount of red and a few of Mena's brothers got it, too. Manjaya seems to have taken after her WC sire, Arlo. A few of Mena's brothers looked like mini Arlo's. So less of the Perregrin/Pyro side of the lineage, more of the WC Arlo combined with Zava is what she brings to the table.
