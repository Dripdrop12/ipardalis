This podcast is a great introduction to our breeding program and philosophy. 

- How we got started individually raising panther chameleons
- Why we chose to focus on Yellow Body Blue Bar (YBBB) Ambilobe
- Challenges related to individually raising
- Selective breeding strategies
- How we track and document things with Gramps software
- Our strategy of transparency - we show hundreds of males from a given pairing and don't cherry pick the best ones.
