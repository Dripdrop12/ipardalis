Robina is a female we acquired from Ramblin' Exotics Clapton x Layla pairing. Her sire, Clapton, and dam sire, DynamiteTNT, both have phenomenal blue bars which I believe will complement Ralph's really well. With any luck, a few Ralph clones could pop out because Robina is an RBBB x RBBB female. She has some interesting turquoise and subtle differences from most of my other females. She is awesome!
