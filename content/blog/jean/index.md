Jean is an extension of our main Ambilobe group via the Jackson tree combined with a beautiful female from Brian Stewart's Ambilobe project. Both her sire, Jackson and dam sire, McNulty, carry many of our favorite ybbb Ambilobe traits and her first clutch had very strong Jackson traits: extra blue bars and sharp yellows!
