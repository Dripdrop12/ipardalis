Great discussion with Amanda & Lee Ready of Ready's Rainforest, The Reptile Gumbo Podcast, and Dr. Rob Coke DVM about egg sales and other random ideas that popped into our heads.

We planned on discussing 

- Ethics
- The impact of egg sales on the community
- Why we choose not to sale eggs 

This was a great show with 2 chameleon breeders and a top reptile veterinarian.
