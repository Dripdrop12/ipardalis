This pairing was between our fourth generation hold back, [Manga]({{< ref "/blog/manga/index.md" >}}), and our female from Ramblin' Exotics, [Imelda]({{< ref "/blog/imelda/index.md" >}}). Imelda is a great mix of WC Gambit lines and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Manga is the male with the most striking yellows from our Bleu x Patch clutch. We kept Jimanga from this group and he has his father's wonderful profile! Just a gorgeous group of Ambilobe.
