{{< load-photoswipe >}}

This has been our most successful pairing to-date. Alla is an amazing female Ambilobe that we purchased from RB Barto in 2017. She has been producing clutches between 25-34 eggs every 60 to 90 days ever since!

We decided to keep [Blossom]({{< ref "/blog/blossom/index.md" >}}), [Jack]({{< ref "/blog/jack/index.md" >}}), and [Afred]({{< ref "/blog/alfred/index.md" >}}) from this pairing as well as numerous females.

# [Jude]({{< ref "/blog/jude/index.md" >}}) x [Alla]({{< ref "/blog/alla/index.md" >}})
