This Ambilobe Panther Chameleon pairing was between our male named [Kiborin]({{< ref "/blog/kiborin/index.md" >}}) from [Blossom]({{< ref "/blog/blossom/index.md" >}}) x [Maitso]({{< ref "/blog/maitso/index.md" >}}), and a female we picked up from Brian Stewart, [Maize]({{< ref "/blog/maize/index.md" >}}). Maize seems to be throwing everything from a beautiful orange body blue bar to a yellow body blue bar while Kiborin was one of our favorite yellow body blue bars from Blossom. This group has been very vibrant and a few males have had the ability to fire up to to point where their blue bars almost go white!
