## [Canvas Chameleons](https://www.canvaschameleons.com)

Canvas Chameleons was one of the top 3 chameleon breeders when we entered the hobby in 2015. Nick Henn did a phenomenal job with the species and his lines are/were scattered all across the United States now. Our favorite male of theirs was a wild caught Ambilobe Panther Chameleon named Bolt (below). Really phenomenal work as a breeder but he also set a great example being transparent about successes and failures on [Chameleon Forums](https://www.chameleonforums.com/). Nick was one of my role models as I got started breeding the species.
