This is a great discussion about our project from an ethical perspective. Dillon over at Animals at Home has created some of the best content on ethical keeping. We were honored to speak with him after he fired an ethical [shot across the bow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O54nOy8cX3o) of herpetoculture.

- Care of the animal comes first - business comes second
- Over production and a breeder's responsibility to market their work
- Egg sales
- Group raising vs individual-raising
- Breeding vs flipping
- Genetics - polygenic traits and selective breeding
- Wild caught and importation
- Parasites and captive health management strategies
