This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Blossom]({{< ref "/blog/blossom/index.md" >}}), and our female from Bobby Ruddock, [Mavokely]({{< ref "/blog/mavokely/index.md" >}}). Mavokely is from one of our favorite yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe, Amarillo, and Blossom is the HB male from our Jude x Alla clutch. Great combination of colorful ybbb and clean yellows!
