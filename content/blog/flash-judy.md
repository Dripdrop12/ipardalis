This was our first clutch. Both parents, Flash and Judy, were sourced from [Bruce Galbraith](http://www.chameleonparadise.net/contact/) at Chameleon's Paradise. Our hatch rate was ~50% and 4 of the babies did not make it to the 3 month mark. That was the baseline that we have tried to improve upon. For this clutch, we had used a standard calcium w/ multivitamin twice a month for most of Judy's life, and we raised the babies in what I would call "standard" baby bins (not fully-planted, bioactive bins like we use today). We housed them all individually in a [Dragon Strand](https://dragonstrand.com/) nursery rack, and fed them primarily crickets after fruit flies (not as many different feeder items as we offer today). We have learned a lot since then!

Jude, our 2nd generation breeder, was our holdback male from this clutch!
