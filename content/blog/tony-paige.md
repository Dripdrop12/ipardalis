This pairing was between our our 4th gen HB from [Nugget]({{< ref "/blog/nugget/index.md" >}}) x [Amara]({{< ref "/blog/amara/index.md" >}}), [Tony]({{< ref "/blog/tony/index.md" >}}), and our female from Tiffany Mallay, [Paige]({{< ref "/blog/paige/index.md" >}}). Paige has great potential from Ambilobe lines from Tropical Chameleons and Modern Day Dragons, and Tony is the spitting image of his dam sire, Artemis, with a little extra yellow from Nugget. These guys hatched out strong and we're hoping to do an encore pairing with Zandrin next year.
