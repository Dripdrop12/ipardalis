It is a live view of how things are going for us as well as a record of the past. We are the first, and only, Panther Chameleon (Furcifer pardalis) breeder to track nearly a decade of statistics working with the species and make them available to the public, free of charge.\n<p>\n<a class=\"btn btn-template-main\" href=\"https://ipardalis.com/data.csv\">Download Chameleon Breeding Data <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i></a>\n</p>\n> We'll be adding visualizations over the coming weeks, so feel free to reach out if you have ideas and we would be happy to hear from you :)\n\n## Totals\n**Dams**: 49\n**Sires**: 26\n\n**Clutches**: 131\n**Eggs Laid**: 3418\n**Babies Hatched**: 2073\n\n## Dam Chart\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n{{{< iframe file_loc=\"plot/dam_plot.html\" fig_width=\"100%\" fig_height=\"300px\" >}}}\n\n## Interactive Table\nYou can search, sort and filter this table to view our breeding statistics however you'd like and click the images to view them full size!
