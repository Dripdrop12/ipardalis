Bibi is a very vibrant wild caught (WC) Ambilobe panther chameleon. Bibidia translates to wild in Malagasy, which is why we named our two WC Bibi and Dia. Bibi has a decent amount of red on his face and blue bars with a vibrant green/yellow body. The yellow covers both his body and bars, so his bars almost look green at times. He is a very unique animal and we are very lucky to work with him. Given he has acclimated pretty well, we hope to produce a decent number of clutches with him to add fresh genetics into the mix!
