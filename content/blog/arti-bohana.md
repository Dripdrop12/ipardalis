This pairing was between our first captive hatched (CH) female, [Bohana]({{< ref "/blog/bohana/index.md" >}}), and our male from Brian Stewart, [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}). Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Bohana is a female Ambilobe hatched out by Busy B's Exotics from a wild caught imported female. Bohana's wild genes didn't seem to add much to our project when combined with Arti, so we did not keep any of these animals.
