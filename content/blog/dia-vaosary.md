This pairing was the only successful clutch with WC Dia. We paired him to our 5th gen female named [Vaosary]({{< ref "/blog/vaosary/index.md" >}}) from [Papafee]({{< ref "/blog/papafee/index.md" >}}) x [Lokana]({{< ref "/blog/lokana/index.md" >}}). Vaosary was a stand out female with a lot of orange from one of my favorite 5th gen groups. Because of how rare this line will be, they are a great option for breeders looking for high-quality foundation animals at the F1 generation. Really love that we got some WC Dia and Papafee clones in the mix here - very cool stuff!
