Lokana is the half-sister of Loko. They each have a 50% chance of bringing Kromatisk's amazing ybbb into our project, but Lokana also has Landy x Hamy from her dam, Shirley's side. Really can't go wrong with the two possibilities here. We are very excited to see how she proves out over the years :).
