Given that wild baby Panther Chameleons are often found in low brush or tall grass, we would like to simulate that as much as possible. So in 2019, we are experimenting with raising our babies in bio bins for the first month. We have multiple soil layers (drainage, abg & leaf) and 3 - 4 species of insects in every bin. Currently, that includes temperate/tropical spring tails, dwarf white isopods, zebra isopods, and powder orange isopods. These insects spend a lot of time in the soil, so my thought is they will provide a good option for the babies along with fruit flies, silk worms, horn worms and bean beetles.

At the end of a month, we will move them all into individual nursery cages and provide gut-loaded crickets, horn worms, silk worms, dubia roaches and various species of larger flies (black soldier, blue bottle and house flies). Once babies hit this stage they will be getting close to an age that most owners can manage successfully!

# Update on 2019 Bio Bins

This basic technique was used on each of our 2019 clutches. We hatched 160 babies in 2019. One was tragically killed by our dog and two passed away at a very young age (my guess is that was due to asphyxiation from water droplets that weighed their bodies down). Many breeders do not share their techniques or failures, so it is difficult to gauge how this compares. However, I am very happy with 98.1% reaching the 3 month mark. This compares favorably to our 2017 clutch, which was not raised in bio bins and only 69.2% reached the 3 month mark. Hopefully, in 2020, we can get it up to a 100% survival rate!
