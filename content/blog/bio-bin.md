Given that wild baby Panther Chameleons are often found in low brush or tall grass, we would like to simulate that as much as possible. So in 2019, we are experimenting with raising our babies in bio bins for the first month of life. We have multiple soil layers (drainage, abg & leaf) and 3 - 4 species of inspects in every bin. Currently, that includes temperate/tropical springtails, dwarf white isopods, zebra isopods, and powder orange isopods. These insects spend a lot of time in the soil, so my thought is they will provide a good option for the babies along with fruit flies, silk worms, horn worms and bean beetles.

At the end of a month, we will move them all into individual nursery cages and provide gut-loaded crickets, horn worms, silk worms, dubia roaches and various species of larger flies (black soldier, blue bottle and house flies). Once babies hit this stage they will be getting close to an age that most owners can manage successfully!
