Maria is an absolutely gorgeous Ambanja Panther Chameleon produced by Ready's Rainforest, one of the few pure wild-type Ambanja breeders in the USA. We are honored to carry on their line. If you look at her tree, there are three different wild-caught sires paired against an older cb line from Linda Nickleson's Spunky x Princess Peach line. Very excited to add these to our Ambanja project and create some nice cb animals like this.
