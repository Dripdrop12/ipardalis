This pairing was between our 5th gen male named [Jimanga]({{< ref "/blog/jimanga/index.md" >}}) from [Manga]({{< ref "/blog/manga/index.md" >}}) x [Imelda]({{< ref "/blog/imelda/index.md" >}}), and a 5th gen female named [Bumble Bee]({{< ref "/blog/bumblebee/index.md" >}}) from [Papafee]({{< ref "/blog/papafee/index.md" >}}) x [Lokana]({{< ref "/blog/Lokana/index.md" >}}). This is the combination of two of our favorite lines and the culmination of years of selective breeding for yellow body blue bar traits. If they don't prove out, we have no one to blame but ourselves! ;)
