Sideshow is one of the most vibrant YBBB Ambilobe I have ever seen. He has clean yellows and electric blues. His personality is also quite quirky, and I am not surprised when he tries to bite a branch that he is perched on. Gotta keep your wits about you when handling Sideshow lol... Longshot Chameleons hit on a jackpot with this guy and we are very lucky to work him into our lineup. Can't wait to see what he produces for us!
