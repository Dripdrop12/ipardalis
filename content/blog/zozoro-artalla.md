{{< load-photoswipe >}}

This pairing was between our only female from [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}) x [Alla]({{< ref "/blog/alla/index.md" >}}), and our male from Kammerflage Kreations, [Zozoro]({{< ref "/blog/zozoro/index.md" >}}). Zozoro brings some nice yellow and blue. His yellow settled into a lime green at rest and his bars were more baby blue than royal blue. Whereas Arti had some great deep blue bars and bit less yellow in the body. This has a lot of Kammerflage on each side of the lineage and it is unrelated to our main line.
