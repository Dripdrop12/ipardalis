Tarehy's name comes from "Tsara Tarehy" which means attractive in Malagasy. We named the two sisters from [Manjaka x Lokana]({{< ref "/blog/manjaka-lokana.md" >}}) Tsara and Tarehy :). Check out that clutch to see how consistent their YBBB phenotypes were. It is a very good proxy for what these two sisters bring to the table: great yellows and bars that shift from Landy to Manjaka's blues. Very good complement to our existing lines!
