This pairing is a great F1 group with WC Bibi paired to our 4th gen female named [Mamony]({{< ref "/blog/mamony/index.md" >}}) from [Blossom]({{< ref "/blog/blossom/index.md" >}}) x [Maitso]({{< ref "/blog/maitso/index.md" >}}). Our hope is that the strong blues on the female side of this lineage will help clean up the mixed bar look of WC Bibi and he'll bring some size and fresh genetics into the mix. WC Bibi's yellows are very interesting and slightly different from Blossom's, so it will also be interesting to watch these animals as they mature.
