This pairing was between our most prolific female from Panther Creek Chameleons, [Alla]({{< ref "/blog/alla/index.md" >}}), and our male from Brian Stewart, [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}). Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Alla is a wonderful female from JJ who was produced by Kammerflage Kreations. We only had a single clutch from these two because it was towards the end of Alla's breeding career.
