Hong is the most astonishing Red Body Blue Bar (RBBB) Ambilobe Panther Chameleon I have seen in person. His colors are velvety smooth. He has a deep red body and beautiful sky blue bars. Ryan Roberson produced him with his WC Ambilobe named Snoop Dog and a female from Brenton Schappel's WC Ambilobe over at Chameleons by Design. Achieving that look at the F1 generation with an F1 female is unheard of - absolutely amazing work by Ryan here. We're hoping Hong will be a pillar in our RBBB Ambilobe project given he is not related to Ralph or Kosmo and he brings some phenomenal traits into the mix!
