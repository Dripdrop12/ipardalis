Miafina is a wild caught (WC) Ambilobe Panther Chameleon. Miafina is derived from the Malagasy word for "mystery" because her phenotype is a complete mystery. We are very excited to prove her out with our WC Tratra who is an Ambilobe male without very much, if any, red highlighting. When we watch her sons develop, we'll get an estimate for what she brings to the table besides fresh WC genetics!
