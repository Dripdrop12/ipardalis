This is a great discussion with three men who have more experience than I do: Bill Strand, Sean McNeeley and Chris Young. These guys are some of the OGs of chameleon husbandry, and I really enjoyed listening as much as I enjoyed the opportunity to share my experience.

**Sorry about the bad entry - I had not done many podcasts at this point lol**
