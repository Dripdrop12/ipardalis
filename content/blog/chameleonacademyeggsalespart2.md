Bill Strand was my original mentor in the hobby. He has more experience than anyone I know. He is accessible, fair and reliable. There is no other source of information on chameleon husbandry that I trust more.

In this episode, we get into a topic that is something I am very passionate about - egg sales. When I heard the framing of this question on Bill's podcast, I sent him a long message and he was kind enough to give me a chance to speak my mind.

I do not believe it is a topic with pros and cons. I believe it is an ethical question with a clear [answer]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}). It is always easy to justify questionable practices by pointing at something that is worse. A healthy, individually-raised juvenile is the standard I hope we can work towards in the hobby. From my work on the topic, I hope that is very clear.
