Jimanga is one of our 5th gen Ambilobe Chameleon breeders. He comes from our Manga x Imelda pairing, a great collab with Ramblin' Exotics. I can trace his personality all the way back to Kako. They teach you that chameleons are a look-but-don't-touch pet, the hard way haha... but what comes with that is an absolutely amazing defense display. Definitely something I really enjoy about these guys!
