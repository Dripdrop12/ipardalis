This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Nugget]({{< ref "/blog/nugget/index.md" >}}), and our captive-hatched Ambilobe female from Busy B's Exotics, [Bohana]({{< ref "/blog/bohana/index.md" >}}). Bohana was hatched from a wild caught female's clutch of eggs and she seems to have a complex set of colors without a dominant phenotype. Nugget is the HB male from our Jude x Kako clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the third generation. This was a great combination of wild Ambilobe genetics and clean yellows! [Nuhana]({{< ref "/blog/nuhana/index.md" >}}) is our keeper from this group.
