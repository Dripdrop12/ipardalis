Coco brings a new WC line from Brightside Chameleon's Gambit into our project via Hendrix/Dante from Ramblin' Exotics! Hendrix is a great mix of two recent WC sires, Gambit and Bolt, and we are very excited to add his daughter to our breeding group. She has phenomenal coloring for a female and has been able to lay and bounce back easily thus far. Very healthy girl!
