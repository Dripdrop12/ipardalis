This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Blossom]({{< ref "/blog/blossom/index.md" >}}), and our female from Bobby Ruddock, [Maitso]({{< ref "/blog/maitso/index.md" >}}). Maitso is from one of our favorite yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe, Amarillo, and Blossom is the HB male from our Jude x Alla clutch. Great combination of colorful ybbb and clean yellows! [Kiborin]({{< ref "/blog/kiborin/index.md" >}}) is our keeper from this group.
