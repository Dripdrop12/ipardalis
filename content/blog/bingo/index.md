Hatched by [One World Exotica](https://www.instagram.com/oneworldexotica/) in July 2024.

Bingo is a captive-hatched (CH) Panther Chameleon that proved to be Ambanja locality. One World Exotica imported his mother who laid eggs in captivity from a wild sire. Then they hatched them out and sent them our way to raise them up. She was originally labelled Ambilobe but they did not color up that way. So as I saw the teal background with Ambanja mixed bars, I immediately picked up a WC and a trio from Ready's Rainforest to begin working with this locality.

For more information on why it took me so long to breed them, check out our [Complete Guide to Ambanja Panther Chameleons]({{< ref "blog/ambanja-panther-chameleons-for-sale" >}}).
