Dehibe is a great YBBB Ambilobe we produced with [Arti]({{< ref "/blog/arti/index.md" >}}) and [Alla]({{< ref "/blog/alla/index.md" >}}). He brings some great blue bars and a yellow body, very similar to his sire. He and his sister, Artalla, were the only two babies to survive Alla's last clutch, and they are very special to us. This is a great cb combination without any of our main line in it.
