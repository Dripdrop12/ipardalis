Lamba is a great YBBB female we produced with Arti and Lilly in the 5th generation of our YBBB project. This group was one of my favorite 5th gen combos and has the potential to throw some of the best yellow bodies anywhere in the world. We are extremely excited to see what Lamba's sons look like. It should be very easy to pick them out around 3-4 months old with their neon yellows!
