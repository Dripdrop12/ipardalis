Manjaia is Manjaka's 3rd sister we own, and she also brings fresh genetics from a new WC sire, Arlo, who was acclimated by Chris Neeley at Colorado Chameleon. Arlo has a distinct look with red sprinkled on blue bars and a nice yellow body. Very cool Ambilobe import and one of the nicer ybbb with red highlights to come in the past few years. We are very lucky to have the opportunity to work with his daughter!

Manjaia came to us later in life after she had actually escaped from her original owner for a few months. We took her on as a rescue with breeding upside potential. She bounced back for us and will hopefully contribute a new line off Arlo :)
