This pairing was between our third generation hold back, [Nugget]({{< ref "/blog/nugget/index.md" >}}), and our female from Brian Stewart, [Amara]({{< ref "/blog/amara/index.md" >}}). Amara proved out to carry a lot of her sire's, Artemis', traits like his dark blue bars and red highlighting. Nugget is the HB male from our Jude x Kako clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the third generation. This was a great combination of colorful ybbb with both blue bars and clean yellows! [Tony]({{< ref "/blog/tony/index.md" >}}) is our keeper from this group.
