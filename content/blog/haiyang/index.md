Imported by [One World Exotica](https://www.instagram.com/oneworldexotica/) in October 2023.

WC Haiyang came in with some face injuries which make him less likely to get the glam shots on social media; however, we are incredibly happy with him from a genetics and breeding standpoint. His blue bars are the best of all of our WC imports from One World Exotica and his body is very nice as well - green/yellow and only some very sparce red/orange markings. He fits incredibly well into our wild-type Ambilobe project!

He is eagerly awaiting the end to quarantine and has given us a few clean fecals since October.
