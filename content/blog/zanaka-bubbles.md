We added [Zanaka]({{< ref "/blog/zanaka/index.md" >}}) (F2) to our project because he is the product of one of [Kammerflage Kreations]({{< ref "blog/kammerflage.md" >}})'s top yellow-bodied Ambilobe, [Promise Keeper]({{< ref "blog/kammerflage.md#manome-toky-promise-keeper" >}}), and a classic WC Ambilobe, [Fanitso]({{< ref "/blog/kammerflage.md#fanitso-herb" >}}). We paired him with both of our main 3rd gen lines from [Jude]({{< ref "blog/jude/index.md" >}}) with the goal of producing something a bit different and adding new blood to the project.
