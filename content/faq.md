We are not trying to make money. We breed chameleons because we love it, and we want others to be able to experience "what it is like to live with dragons" - Bill Strand. This means we take very good care of our animals because we are not trying to turn a profit. It also means you get a beautiful, healthy animal if you buy from us.

## 1. HOW DO I GET MY CHAMELEON?

After we have seen a picture of his/her enclosure. We only send our chameleons to homes that have been vetted by us.

Then you can pick him/her up at the nearest FedEx distribution center, usually the nearest airport. We will not ship direct because it is impossible to know if you are the first or last stop on the delivery route and it is the best way to gaurantee your pet's safety.

If you live near Poolesville, MD, stop by and pick him/her up from our house. That will save you money, reduce the stress of shipping, and you get the pick of the clutch!

## 2. WHAT ARE THE POSTAL RATES?

Expect to pay about $60 in shipping. We use FedEx Priority overnight.

## 3. DO YOU SEND OVERSEAS?

Nope.

## 4. WHY ARE YOU MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS?

We are not a puppy mill. If you want cheap, sick animals with hit-or-miss quality, that's not us.

## 5. HOW DO I ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HUSBANDRY?
