At iPardalis, our mission goes beyond breeding vibrant, healthy panther chameleons. As a small-batch panther chameleon breeding company, we are deeply committed to conservation, education, and ethical reptile care. That's why we proudly support organizations like Wildlife Madagascar, Responsible Reptile Keeping, Chameleon Forums, Reptifiles, and USARK, and contribute educational content to the Chameleon Academy. Here's why these partnerships are at the core of our philosophy.

### Preserving Wild Habitats: Wildlife Madagascar

Wildlife Madagascar plays a critical role in conserving Madagascar's unique biodiversity, including the panther chameleon's native habitat. By donating to Wildlife Madagascar, iPardalis supports habitat protection and restoration initiatives that ensure these magnificent reptiles have a future in the wild. Conservation is not just important for chameleons --- it's vital for the entire ecosystem.

**Sponsor since:** May, 2024

### Promoting Ethical Breeding: Responsible Reptile Keeping

Responsible Reptile Keeping champions ethical standards within the reptile industry. They advocate for responsible breeding practices, humane treatment, and proper education for reptile keepers. Our donations help them promote integrity within the reptile community, aligning with our values of transparency, small-batch breeding, and reptile welfare.

**Sponsor since:** January, 2024
**Donation total:** \$195

### Building Community Knowledge: Chameleon Forums

Chameleon Forums is a leading online community where reptile enthusiasts share advice, experiences, and research. iPardalis proudly supports this platform because it empowers chameleon owners to access critical husbandry information. A well-informed keeper means healthier, happier chameleons --- a goal we deeply believe in.

**Sponsor since:** December, 2020
**Donation total:** \$1000

### Providing Trusted Resources: Reptifiles

Reptifiles creates detailed, evidence-based care guides for a wide range of reptiles. Their panther chameleon care sheets are especially valuable for both new and experienced keepers. By contributing to Reptifiles, we ensure that reliable, science-backed resources remain accessible to anyone who wants to provide the best care for their chameleons.

**Sponsor since:** February, 2024
**Donation total:** \$3500

### Protecting Reptile Keepers' Rights: USARK

The United States Association of Reptile Keepers (USARK) fights for the rights of reptile owners and breeders. Legislative threats could severely restrict the ability to responsibly keep and breed reptiles. iPardalis donates to USARK to help defend responsible reptile keeping and to protect the freedom to continue our work with these incredible animals.

**Sponsor since:** February, 2022
**Donation total:** \$750

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sharing Knowledge: The Chameleon Academy

We are honored to produce educational content for the Chameleon Academy, the leading resource for panther chameleon husbandry education. From podcasts to husbandry courses, the Academy provides high-quality, science-based knowledge to the global chameleon community. Our involvement ensures that the next generation of keepers and breeders is equipped with the best information available.

### Our Promise

At iPardalis, we believe that breeding panther chameleons is not just a hobby --- it is a responsibility. Supporting conservation efforts, promoting ethical breeding, strengthening the reptile community, and providing educational resources are all ways we give back to the animals that inspire us every day.

When you choose iPardalis, you're not just getting a beautiful, healthy panther chameleon. You're supporting a movement dedicated to responsible reptile care, conservation, and education.
