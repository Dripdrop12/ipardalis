# Reserve first, pick first

We run a $75 reservation program for all of our upcoming clutches. Reservations are 100% refundable for any reason and will be applied to your balance when you're ready to ship. When the first group of babies reaches the 3 month mark, we run down the reservation list before offering any to the public. You pick out your cham in the order that you pay, so early reservations get early picks. If you choose to pass or do not respond to our message within 24 hours, we will post the animals for sale.

Our goal with the reservation program is to work with customers to get them a young juvenile that carries the traits they are interested in. It often involves looking at adults and comparing 3-month old pictures to see how they have developed. It is a very rough science, but we have watched hundreds of babies mature and it is your best bet if you have a specific look you want.
