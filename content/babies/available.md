iPardalis (individually-raised pardalis) is a responsible reptile breeding project founded in 2015 with the goal of proving that ethical rearing practices of Furcifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons) can be profitable. Today, individually-raising panther chameleons is much more common, so much so that many businesses have adopted the practice. We are proud to say we were there on the ground pushing for that shift in the industry, after listening to Bill Strand's [Chameleon Academy Podcast](https://chameleonacademy.com/podcasts/), and things have come a long way.

Before iPardalis was founded in 2015, most of the Panther Chameleon industry housed their hatchlings and juveniles in groups, large and small, where they had to fight for survival in an unnaturally competitive space. In the wild, hatchlings quickly disperse into their own micro-habitats. They are solitary animals from day 1. They prefer to communicate at a distance with some of nature's most beautiful courtship and threat displays; however, when they cannot flee or show submissiveness in a small space, dominant animals will try to kill animals in their territory (male and female). Baby Panther Chameleons are not strong enough to follow through with their intention, but it is clear nonetheless! 

Individually-raising has been a win-win shift for Panther Chameleons and keepers alike. Without the stress, disease and battle scarring that comes with group-raising, they are hearty, healthy, more colorful, larger and do not have any baggage due to [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) (this can easily be confused with friendliness. It is a huge red flag if someone uses the term "friendly" to describe their chameleons). Individually-raised Furcifer pardalis are some of the most beautiful, multi/pure-colored animals from Madagascar available to hobbyists in the United States.

Our listings are exclusively juveniles or older - no hatchlings or [eggs]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}) - we do not sell juveniles under 12 grams of weight regardless of their age. Every iPardalis Panther Chameleon has a [life-long guarantee]({{< ref "tos.md" >}}). Whatever issue you encounter, even years later, we want to be part of the solution. Keep in touch, and we will ensure that you have a positive experience.
