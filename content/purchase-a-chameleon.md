{{< faq title="How soon can I expect my Panther Chameleon after buying them?" >}}
We only send our chameleons to homes that are prepared to receive them, so the next step is to share pictures of your enclosure and discuss your husbandry strategy. We ship FedEx Priority Overnight to the closest hub for pick up or meet you locally, in Poolesville, MD. It takes some time to get the setup right, and we will advise you on any adjustments you should make before receiving your new chameleon. We will not ship door-to-door because your chameleon would sit in a delivery truck, exposed to the elements, for too long. It's not worth the risk.
