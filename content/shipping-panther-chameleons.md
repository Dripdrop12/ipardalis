{{< faq title="Is Shipping Chameleons Safe?" >}}
We have been shipping our Panther Chameleons all around the United States for nearly 10 years now. It is a safe process when done properly.  We use FedEx Priority Overnight to the closest FedEx hub location for pick up **only**. We avoid door-to-door shipping because many DoAs are the result of animals being left in delivery trucks too long or exposed to hot or cold temperatures throughout the day as it winds its way to its final destination.

{{< faq title="What are safe weather conditions to ship Panther Chameleons in?" >}}
Every shipment is contingent on weather conditions and we will delay shipments if any leg of the journey is too hot or too cold. Heat and cooling packs are used under certain conditions to keep your cham safe, but there are ranges (below 38 degrees or above 95 degrees) in which we will not ship. Their box is insulated and the temperature controls are designed to last through a short delay if it does occur.
