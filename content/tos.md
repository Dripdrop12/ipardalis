By purchasing from iPardalis, you are agreeing to our terms of service.

## Shipping Info

**We require pictures of your enclosure pre-shipment**

We ship Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday via FedEx Priority Overnight for next day arrival. iPardalis has live arrival gaurantees on all shipments.

FedEx requires a phone # for shipping live animals in case they need to reach out to the recipient directly. We will also need to look up the closest shipping center to your zip code and confirm prior to shipping.

## Quality Gauranteed

We gaurantee the quality of our animals. On top of our live arrival gaurantee, if you are unsatisfied for any reason, you can request a 100% refund/replacement upon safe return to iPardalis. We will want to understand your reasoning, so please be prepared to discuss and share pictures. If it is determined that improper care resulted in injury, poor health or death, then this gaurantee is null and void. Please note, you will be responsible for shipping in the case of a replacement/refund.

## Deposits

Deposits are 100% refundable for any reason and applied to the balance when you are ready to ship. For example, if you pay a $75 deposit to hold a $325 female, then $250 plus shipping and sales tax will be due before you ship.
