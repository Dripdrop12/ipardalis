[Our Panther Chameleons for sale]({{< ref "/panther-chameleons-for-sale" >}}) are some of the highest quality captive bred Ambilobe Panther Chameleons in the United States. You can dig into their lineage, view their picture galleries and find one that you like. Then add it to your cart and check out.

We only send our chameleons to homes that are prepared to receive them, so the next step is to share pictures of your enclosure and discuss your husbandry strategy. We ship FedEx Priority Overnight to the closest hub for pick up or meet you locally, in Poolesville, MD. It takes some time to get the setup right, and we will advise you on any adjustments you should make before receiving your new chameleon. We will not ship door-to-door because your chameleon would sit in a delivery truck, exposed to the elements, for too long. It's not worth the risk.

We highly encourage you to work with someone dedicated to the species because then you are more likely to get the support you need and you are less likely to get scammed. There are a ton of people trying to flip or [drop ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping) Panther Chameleons. There are numerous websites at the top of Google search which are just AI generated nonsense with weird or stolen images. Many "breeders" (scammers) modify their images - please look at the surroundings and background lighting to see if they match the chameleon or if their skin is oddly orange in color. You will not get what you paid for. **Please, breeder in the name is not enough - confirm they are dedicated to a multi-generational project and aren't just over-producing off other people's lines or re-posting images and videos of animals that are long gone.** One of my favorite red flags is the "greatest hits" breeders who continually re-post their greatest hits instead of their current projects. Double those red flags when those "greatest hits" are animals they purchased from someone else ;). If you have a question about the industry - reach out. We will tell you everything we know.

If multi-generational captive bred Ambilobe Panther Chameleons are not what you are looking for, check out the dozens of [partners]({{< ref "/categories/lineage" >}}) we have worked with. We can help you find good quality Ambanja, Nosy Be, Nosy Mitsio, Sambava, or Nosy Faly. We have acquired captive bred lines from dozens of great breeders over the years, and we are happy to discuss our experience with any one of them if you find something you are interested in. Here are a few partners who we have worked with for many years and deserve special call-outs for their contributions to our project:

1. [Brian Stewart]({{< ref "/blog/brianstewart.md" >}}) - an all-time great breeder of the species. Brian's Ambanja are in most captive lines in the United States today.
2. [One World Exotica](https://oneworldexotica.com/) - our favorite importer. Jay is very particular about where his animals go and makes sure they end up with experienced breeders and keepers. I respect his craft and we are the beneficiary of his work.
3. [Kammerflage Kreations]({{< ref "/blog/kammerflage.md" >}}) - oldest captive bred lines in the United States. If you breed Ambilobe, Nosy Be, Sambava or Ambanja, chances are, you are breeding one of Ed Kammer's lines. It is very difficult to work with captive bred animals that can't be traced to Ed's work.
4. [Chromatic Chameleons]({{< ref "/blog/chromatic.md" >}}) - like-minded Ambilobe breeders who also have some Ambanja and Nosy be projects.
5. [Ramblin' Exotics]({{< ref "/blog/ramblin.md" >}}) - Robbie and Elizabeth are two of my favorite people in the hobby. Their Nosy Be project is one of my favorites. They brought in a a few exceptional wild-caught males from Jay and are producing amazing F1 offspring.

There are others who we would include on this list but have moved on from the species like Frank Payne, Nick Henn, Bobby Ruddock, Jim Rykbost, RB Barto, Jeremy Booker, etc. They have all contributed to our project in various ways through their work with Furcifer pardalis.

Here are a few breeders we have not worked with but stalk their projects with keen interest:

1. [Roberson Reptiles](https://www.robersonreptiles.com/) - Ryan has been creating some of the most unique F1 in the United States. He is currently the only person I know who has successfully acclimated Maroantsetra, Ankaramy, Masoala, among other obscure and interesting locales.
2. [Ready's Rainforest](https://readysrainforest.com/) - Lee and Amanda have the best pure locale Ambanja in the United States. Most of the captive lines have been muddied up with RBBB Ambilobe and Nosy Be to produce designer cross purple chameleons (blurples), so it is very hard to find good, pure Ambanja like theirs!

We are very happy to share whatever we know that isn't on this page. Please reach out if you have any questions about how to purchase a panther chameleon.
