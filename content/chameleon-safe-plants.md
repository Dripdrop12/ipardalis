There is a lot of misinformation about chameleon safe plants on the internet. Most plants are safe for chameleons and there are only a few exceptions that we are aware of. However, some blogs list many different "unsafe" plants simply because they are toxic to humans, cats or dogs. That's often incomplete information and does not square with our decades of experience keeping chameleons with live plants.

{{< faq title="What plants are safe for chameleons?" >}}
The definition of a safe chameleon plant is that a chameleon can eat it without any negative health effects. That's why our favorite [chameleon safe plant list](https://chameleonacademy.com/plants/) is maintained by Chameleon Academy where they use the "Veiled tested" label. That means a Veiled Chameleon has been documented eating it safely.

We also like Maddie's [top 5 chameleon safe plants list](https://www.zenhabitats.com/blogs/reptile-care-sheets-resources/best-plants-for-chameleon-enclosures) over at Zen Habitats. Ficus, pothos and umbrellas are definitely our go-to plants for larger enclosures while we like to use oats, field peas, grass and hairy vetch in our baby enclosures.

{{< faq title="Are spider plants safe for chameleons?" >}}
Yes - spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum) are great trailing plants. They can be used much like a Pothos, mounted to the wall and trailing down the side. They provide great surface area for drinking and hiding.

{{< faq title="Are all pothos safe for chameleons?" >}}
As far as we know, pothos are safe for chameleons. Even though they are listed on some other toxic plant lists, hobbyists have been using them safely for decades. They are hardy and Veiled-tested.

{{< faq title="Are fake plants safe in my chameleon cage?" >}}
Yes - we use fake plants in temporary and quarantine settings where cleanliness is at a premium and we don't want to spend a fortune every deep cleaning session. There are plenty of chameleons that have lived long healthy lives among fake plants, but I would highly encourage you to incorporate live plants into your chameleon husbandry as soon as possible.

{{< faq title="How to keep plants alive in a chameleon cage?" >}}
Pay attention to their water requirements and get a soil reader to check instead of guessing on their water schedule. Some species like, Umbrella plants, like to dry out between watering sessions; whereas, others such as Pothos and Ficus can stay pretty wet. Don't treat them all the same - your Umbrellas will die on you.

{{< faq title="How to mount live plants in a chameleon cage?" >}}
Our favorite cheap and dirty method involves six 8' 2"x2". Cut three in half and screw two halves into the frame of a Reptibreeze XL enclosure with a 2'x4' coroplast sheet in the middle. That creates a solid side and a pair of boards you can screw directly into. Then cut the other three into 2' lengths and screw them in on the inside of the enclosure at whatever level you would like to hang your plants. That keeps the weight off the screen, much like the best solution - a [Dragon Strand ledge](https://dragonstrand.com/dragon-ledges/).
