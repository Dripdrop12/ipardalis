Panther Chameleons usually cost between $200 and $500 with the exceptional specimen costing $500-$800. The factors which impact their price are health, lineage, current color profile, size for their age and the market demand for specific traits, such as a yellow body (my favorite). Females usually cost about $100 less than males because they don't live as long or display the same bright colors. For a good breakdown on cost of ownership, Olimpia Martinotti's [2012 blog post](http://www.muchadoaboutchameleons.com/2012/03/average-cost-of-owning-chameleon.html) on the topic has aged extremely well.

Beware of unusually high prices because those are indicative of flippers/drop shippers who need to charge a mark up - find the source and save yourself $300+. You will often notice these expensive animals have oddly cartoonish backgrounds or a gentleman with oompa loompa hands (orange). They doctor the photos and charge more but they don't understand their animals and can't tell you much about them. Please check out our [partners]({{< ref "/categories/lineage" >}}) and reach out if you need the scoop. We are happy to help you understand pricing or other industry-related questions.

High prices can also be because a breeder isn't providing proper care, so the few animals they can keep alive cost more to cover their loses. We can say this with confidence. When you strive to provide top-quality husbandry and enrichment to your animals, you have inventory problems because they are all living happy and healthy lives, occupying your cages. Most of the people marking up their animals are just trying to cover the loses of dozens of poor baby chameleons they couldn't care for properly. Don't reward people who can't maintain a healthy inventory of beautiful Panther Chameleons to choose from.
