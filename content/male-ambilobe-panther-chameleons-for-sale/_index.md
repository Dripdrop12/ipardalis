## Why Choose a Reputable Panther Company?
Selecting a reliable company ensures that you receive a healthy and well-cared-for panther chameleon. Reputable companies provide detailed information about the chameleon's lineage, health records, and proper care instructions. They also offer support and guidance to help you provide the best environment for your new pet. There are numerous flippers who call themselves breeders - **be very careful about working with an intermediary instead of the actual source**. We only sell chameleons we have bred and hatched ourselves within our multi-generational project. The rare exception is a male who doesn't prove out the way we hoped.

- [**Rainbow Chameleon for Sale**]({{< ref "/rainbow-ambilobe-panther-chameleons-for-sale" >}}): These are classic local forms of panther chameleons such as [Ambanja]({{< ref "blog/ambanja-panther-chameleons-for-sale" >}}), [Ambilobe]({{< ref "blog/ambilobe-panther-chameleons-usa" >}}) or even local form crosses known for the extreme variety of colors.

### Are chameleons expensive to keep?
The total cost of owning a chameleon is around $1,000 for the intial setup and $50 per month on food. For a good breakdown on cost of ownership, Olimpia Martinotti's [2012 blog post](http://www.muchadoaboutchameleons.com/2012/03/average-cost-of-owning-chameleon.html) on the topic has aged extremely well.

## Tips for Buying a Panther Chameleon

- **Research**: Learn about panther chameleon care, including habitat setup, diet, and health needs - [Panther Chameleon Care Guide](https://chameleonacademy.com/panther-chameleon-care/).
- **Visit the Company**: If possible, visit the company's facility to see how the chameleons are kept.
- **Ask Questions**: Inquire about the chameleon's health, age, lineage, and any guarantees or support offered.
- **Check for Signs of Health**: Look for active eyes, good balance, and relaxed colors (too vibrant is an indication of stress/illness).
- **Prepare the Habitat**: Before bringing your chameleon home, ensure you have a proper enclosure, UVB lighting, and a diet of live insects.

## Where should you buy a Panther Chameleon?
It is best to work with a company that specializes in Panther Chameleons and the locality you are interested in acquiring. Flippers and "gotta catch 'em all" houses have difficulty staying organized and keeping things straight, especially if they are group raising multiple locales or purchasing wholesale from the actual source before selling the chameleons to their customers. You are more likely to get the support you need from a specialist, and you are less likely to get scammed.  

### Why do certain Panther Chameleon Companies Charge More?
Beware of unusually high prices because those are indicative of flippers/drop shippers who need to charge a mark up - find the source and save yourself $300+. They are not charging more because the animals are higher quality - often it is because they can't keep them alive and they are sick. You will often notice these expensive animals have oddly cartoonish backgrounds, light colors which match the chameleon "color," or a gentleman with oompa loompa (orange) hands in the picture. The scammers using Photoshop will charge more, but they don't know what they're doing and can't help you succeed with Panther Chameleons. Please check out our [partners]({{< ref "/categories/lineage" >}}) and reach out if you want to know if someone is reputable. We are happy to help you understand pricing or other industry-related questions.

### Does a high-priced Panther Chameleon mean they receive high quality care?
No. Companies which don't provide proper care need to charge more to cover their loses. We can say this with confidence: when you strive to provide top-quality husbandry and enrichment to your animals, you have inventory problems and need to charge less to find homes for them. They grow extremely fast under ideal conditions. Most of the people charging high prices are just trying to cover the loses of dozens of poor chameleons they couldn't care for properly. Don't reward people who can't maintain an inventory of Panther Chameleons because companies keeping them properly will most likely have some individuals that they are willing to give you for free.

### Common Panther Chameleon Scams
There are a numerous "reputable" companies that flip or [drop ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping) Panther Chameleons. Most of the websites that rank well on Google search are just AI generated nonsense with anatomically incorrect or stolen images in their ads. 

Many "reputable" companies modify their images - please look at the surroundings and background lighting to see if the lighting matches the chameleon or if the person has oompa loompa colored hands. Those chameleons will look very different in person and are likely over-priced cross-locality animals. 

I can't tell you how many times I have talked to people who got scammed buying a $1k+ Panther Chameleon that they can't give away for free. **Please, a company with "chameleon breeders" in the name is not enough** - confirm they are dedicated to a multi-generational project and aren't just over-producing off other company's lines or re-posting images and videos of animals that they sold years ago. They will try to sell you babies from them today. There are numerous websites and popular social media accounts that are notorious for this practice.

One of the most common red flags is the "greatest hits" social media accounts that continually re-post their greatest hits instead of their current projects. Double those red flags when those "greatest hits" are animals they acquired from someone else. If you have a question about the industry - reach out. We would be happy to share our experience.

Finally, avoid anyone selling Panther Chameleon eggs - it is one of the most well-known [Panther Chameleon scams]({{< ref "/blog/egg_sales_101.md" >}}) on the market. It is a decent litmus test for other ethical lapses.

## Reputable Panther Chameleon Companies List
Check out our [partners]({{< ref "/categories/lineage" >}}). We can help you find good quality Ambanja, Nosy Be, Nosy Mitsio, Sambava, or Nosy Faly. We have acquired captive bred lines from dozens of great companies over the years, and we are happy to discuss our experience with any one of them if you find something you are interested in. 

Here are a few partners who we have worked with for many years and deserve special call-outs for their contributions to our project:

1. [Brian Stewart]({{< ref "/blog/brianstewart.md" >}}) - an all-time great. Brian's Ambanja are in most captive lines in the United States today.
2. [One World Exotica](https://oneworldexotica.com/) - our favorite importer. Jay is very particular about where his animals go and makes sure they end up with experienced enthusiasts and keepers. I respect his craft and we are the beneficiary of his work.
3. [Kammerflage Kreations]({{< ref "/blog/kammerflage.md" >}}) - oldest captive bred lines in the United States. If you breed Ambilobe, Nosy Be, Sambava or Ambanja, chances are, you are breeding one of Ed Kammer's lines. It is very difficult to work with captive bred animals that can't be traced to Ed's work.
4. [Chromatic Chameleons]({{< ref "/blog/chromatic.md" >}}) - like-minded company that also has some Ambanja and Nosy be projects.
5. [Ramblin' Exotics]({{< ref "/blog/ramblin.md" >}}) - Robbie and Elizabeth are two of my favorite people in the hobby. Their Nosy Be project is one of my favorites. They brought in a a few exceptional wild-caught males from Jay and are producing amazing F1 offspring.

There are others who we would include on this list but have moved on from the species like Frank Payne, Nick Henn, Bobby Ruddock, Jim Rykbost, RB Barto, Jeremy Booker, etc. They have all contributed to our project in various ways through their work with Furcifer pardalis.

Here are a few companies we have not worked with directly, but we follow their projects with keen interest:

1. [Roberson Reptiles](https://www.robersonreptiles.com/) - Ryan has been creating some of the most unique F1 in the United States. He is currently the only person I know who has successfully acclimated Maroantsetra, Ankaramy, Masoala, among other obscure and interesting locales.
2. [Ready's Rainforest](https://readysrainforest.com/) - Lee and Amanda have the best pure locale Ambanja in the United States. Most of the captive lines in the United States have been muddied up with RBBB Ambilobe and Nosy Be to produce designer cross purple chameleons (blurples), so it is very hard to find good, pure Ambanja like theirs.

## Conclusion

Purchasing a panther chameleon is an exciting decision that comes with the responsibility of providing proper care. By choosing a reputable company and understanding the costs and requirements, you can enjoy the beauty and unique personality of your new pet. Whether you're looking for a specific locality/morph or just starting with a baby chameleon, this page has you covered. Happy chameleon hunting!
