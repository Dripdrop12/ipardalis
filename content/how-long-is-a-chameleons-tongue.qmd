Picture possessing a tongue that extends more than twice the length of your body. Now, envision your ability to launch it across the room to snag an object with precision. This is the astonishing hunting technique employed by chameleons, showcased vividly in this high-speed National Geographic video, slowed down to 1/50th of its original speed. Through intensive research into smaller species—some of which can perch comfortably on your thumb—Professor Anderson has unearthed a remarkable revelation: the tongues of smaller chameleon species possess an unparalleled elasticity and velocity, surpassing their larger counterparts [@andersonShotScalingBallistic2016]. Clocking in at a mind-boggling zero to 60 mph in a mere 1/100th of a second, their tongues boast unparalleled acceleration, outstripping those of any other reptiles, birds, or mammals. This extraordinary burst of power is used instead of the energy that would typically be expended in maneuvering their small bodies toward their prey.

## Introduction

The main species of chameleons kept in captivity are the Veiled Chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus), Panther Chameleon (Furcifer pardalis), Jackson's Chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii), Carpet Chameleon (Furcifer lateralis), Parson’s Chameleon (Calumma parsonii parsonii) and the Oustalet's chameleon (Furcifer oustaleti). These enigmatic creatures renowned for their remarkable ability to change color, possess a highly specialized piece of anatomy - their tongues. While their color-changing prowess often steals the spotlight, the length and agility of a chameleon's tongue is actually one of the features which truly sets them apart from the rest of the animal kingdom. In this article, we discuss the astonishing anatomy of a chameleon's tongue, delving into the evolutionary adaptations that make it a formidable tool for hunting and survival. After reading this article, you will understand why a chameleon's tongue is so long and how it works.

## Chameleon Anatomy

Before diving into the specifics of a chameleon's tongue, let's start with the fundamentals of their anatomy. These reptiles are equipped with a unique set of features that enable their extraordinary hunting capabilities. With independently rotating eyes, prehensile tails, and specialized feet, chameleons are specialized predators. They tend to be what is often referred to as a "sit and wait" predator which lays in wait for prey items to come to them. Then they use their tongue to go get it without having to move too far from their perch.

{{{< faq title="How Long is a Chameleon's Tongue?" >}}}
On average, a chameleon's tongue is roughly one to two times the length of its body with smaller chameleons species having tongue projection lengths up to 2.5 times their body length (snout to vent). The tongue acceleration and power measurements from small chameleon species are the highest recorded among all mammals, birds or reptiles [@andersonShotScalingBallistic2016], including larger species of chameleons. Such elongation is made possible by specialized muscles and connective tissues within the chameleon's mouth, allowing for rapid extension and retraction.

{{{< faq title="Why Do Chameleons Have Long Tongues?" >}}}
The extraordinary length and agility of a chameleon's tongue are the result of millions of years of evolution. In their natural habitats, chameleons often inhabit dense foliage where capturing prey requires swift and accurate movements. Over time, natural selection has favored individuals with longer tongues, enabling them to outcompete their rivals in the hunt for food.

Furthermore, the versatility of a chameleon's tongue allows it to target a wide range of prey, from small insects to larger arthropods. This adaptability enhances the chameleon's chances of survival in diverse ecosystems, showcasing the remarkable efficiency of evolutionary processes.

Unlike most animals, a chameleon's tongue is an elongated muscular structure that can extend to remarkable lengths in the blink of an eye. This ability is crucial for capturing prey, as chameleons primarily rely on their tongues to snatch insects with unparalleled precision. Compared to locomotion-centric hunting strategies, the elastic recoil mechanism of a chameleon tongue is more effective in cool temperatures as compared to other cold blooded predators that need to heat up before they hunt.

{{{< faq title="How do Chameleon Tongues Work?" >}}}

> The chameleon tongue can be separated into three distinct elements, each playing an essential role in the projection mechanism: the entoglossal process, the accelerator muscle and the network of intralingual sheaths. The entire tongue complex rests on a central bone called the entoglossal process, which is mostly parallel-sided, except for the tapering at the anterior-most 1-1.5% of its length. Attached to the entoglossal process are the intralingual sheaths. This region consists of collagenous tissue between the accelerator muscle and the bone, where recent research [@andersonShotScalingBallistic2016] has revealed that these sheaths play a vital role in energy storage and release during projection. - [@shunyuanxiaomarcsroursophieallardBiomechanicalReviewAnimal2023]

{{{< faq title="How Fast can a Chameleon's Tongue Travel?" >}}}
When a chameleon spots its prey, it initiates a lightning-fast sequence of movements. First, it focuses its binocular vision on the target with remarkable accuracy while it pre-loads its tongue. Then, the chameleon's tongue is rapidly propelled forward, reaching speeds of over 12 miles per hour in 1/100th of a second.

This lightning-fast motion finishes with a slower retraction phase when the prey is pulled back into the chameleon's mouth where it is crushed with astonishing force. Once captured, the chameleon's tongue pouch ensures that the insect remains firmly attached, preventing any chance of escape. This entire process unfolds in a fraction of a second, showcasing the agility and precision of chameleon prey capture mechanisms.

{{{< faq title="How far can a Chameleon's Tongue Stretch?" >}}}
A chameleon's tongue can project out one to two body lengths, snout to vent, with some smaller species, such as the Rosette-nosed Chameleon (Rhampholeon spinosus), being able to project their tongues a full 2.5 body lengths. Calumma p. parsonii has a long tongue, but relative to its large size, its tongue is proportionately smaller than species of chameleons like Brookesia superciliaris or Trioceros hoehnelii.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the length of a chameleon's tongue serves as a testament to the ingenuity of nature's design. From its lightning-fast projection to its retraction and capture capabilities, the chameleon's tongue is a marvel of evolutionary adaptation. By unraveling the mysteries of this extraordinary organ, we gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate workings of these amazing animals. So, the next time you look at your chameleon, take a moment to marvel at the hidden wonder within its mouth - a tongue that is more powerful and longer relative to its body length than any other reptile, bird or mammal.
