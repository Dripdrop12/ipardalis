description : "iPardalis is the only panther chameleon breeder that shares detailed ancestry reports, dendrograms and galleries of every clutch over nearly a decade of work. They have also written analysis of the genetic implications for breeding Furcifer pardalis and helped crowd fund a project which will help develop a commercial test for local form using a small piece of shed skin."
