# What is the lifespan of a Panther Chameleon?

In captivity, Male Panther Chameleons live between five and twelve years whereas females live between three and six years. In the wild, it is quite rare to see an individual live longer than one or two years due to predation, extreme weather events and harsh conditions. We are still learning what the ideal husbandry is for Panther Chameleons, so they are living longer today than they were even five year ago. A male's average lifespan is probably around six to eight years under standard care with females living between four and six years. Check out [The Chameleon Academy](https://chameleonacademy.com/podcasts/) and learn about the latest husbandry techniques if you want to join us and shoot for that upper limit! We have not had enough chameleons living under controlled conditions with natural sources of hydration long enough to know what that top limit actually is.
