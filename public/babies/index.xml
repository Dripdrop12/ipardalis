      <description>Reserve first, pick first We run a $75 reservation program for all of our upcoming clutches. Reservations are 100% refundable for any reason and will be applied to your balance when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to ship. When the first group of babies reaches the 3 month mark, we run down the reservation list before offering any to the public. You pick out your cham in the order that you pay, so early reservations get early picks.</description>
