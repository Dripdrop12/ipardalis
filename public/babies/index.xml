      <description>Reserve first, pick first We run a $75 reservation program for all of our upcoming clutches. Reservations are 100% refundable for any reason and will be applied to your balance when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to ship. When the first group of babies reaches the 3 month mark, we run down the reservation list before offering any to the public.</description>
