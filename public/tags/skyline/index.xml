      <description>Kosma is Kosmo&amp;rsquo;s sister. Kosmo is one of my favorite RBBB Ambilobe produced over the past few years. He was sold as an egg by Eric Thompson, purchased as a juvenile by LA Chams and then we acquired him and his sister, Kosma, so we could have a solid RBBB Ambilobe project with two unrelated lines. However, because of their many homes, their lineage information was not very well maintained.</description>

However, because of his many homes, his lineage information was not very well maintained. We know he was from Skyline and another Eric Thompson female, so I do not recommend pairing his offspring with anything from Chameleons101.</description>
