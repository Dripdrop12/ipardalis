      <description>This pairing is a great F1 group with WC Bibi paired to our 4th gen female named Mamony from Blossom x Maitso. Our hope is that the strong blues on the female side of this lineage will help clean up the mixed bar look of WC Bibi and he&amp;rsquo;ll bring some size and fresh genetics into the mix. WC Bibi&amp;rsquo;s yellows are very interesting and slightly different from Blossom&amp;rsquo;s, so it will also be interesting to watch these animals as they mature.</description>

      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in June 2022.&#xA;Bibi is a very vibrant wild caught (WC) Ambilobe panther chameleon. Bibidia translates to wild in Malagasy, which is why we named our two WC Bibi and Dia. Bibi has a decent amount of red on his face and blue bars with a vibrant green/yellow body. The yellow covers both his body and bars, so his bars almost look green at times.</description>
