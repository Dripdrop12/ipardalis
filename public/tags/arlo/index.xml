      <description>This pairing was between our female from Nugget x Loko, and our male from Colorado Chameleons, F1 Manjaka. Manjaka was pretty unassuming as a juvenile, but he became one of our favorite YBBB Ambilobe breeders as an adult. He had an extra blue bar, and yellows were classic Ambilobe. Loko came to us from Chromatic Chameleons and Nugget is our favorite 3rd gen YBBB breeder.&#xA;Hatch dates 11/19/22 - 11/29/22 Hatch rate 24/24 M1</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our female from Nugget x Amara, and our male from Colorado Chameleons, F1 Manjaka. Manjaka was pretty unassuming as a juvenile, but he became one of our favorite YBBB Ambilobe breeders as an adult. He had an extra blue bar, and yellows were classic Ambilobe. Amara came to us from Brian Stewart and her lineage is more rainbow Ambilobe.&#xA;Hatch dates 11/03/22 - 11/07/2022 Hatch rate 23/23 F1</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our F1 female from WC Arlo x Perregrin/Pyro&amp;rsquo;s daughter, and our male from Kammerflage Kreations, Zava. Zava was a vibrant rainbow Ambilobe. His yellow sat on top of a bright red dermal layer, and his bars were deep royal blue. F1 Manjaya brings fresh genetics and a chance at that Perregrin/Sparkles yellow.&#xA;Hatch dates 7/27/22 - 8/21/2022 Hatch rate 8/14 F1&#xA;F2&#xA;F3&#xA;M1&#xA;M2</description>

      <description>This pairing was between one of our F1 females from Colorado Chameleon, Manjalla, and our male from Brian Stewart, Arti. They both come from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations. The clutch was small and Manjalla was very weak, so we were only able to keep one baby alive from this group.&#xA;Hatch dates 8/19/2022 - 8/20/2022 Hatch rate 2/17 M1</description>

      <description>Mena is our HB from Zava and F1 Manjaya. Zava had a significant amount of red and a few of Mena&amp;rsquo;s brothers got it, too. Manjaya seems to have taken after her WC sire, Arlo. A few of Mena&amp;rsquo;s brothers looked like mini Arlo&amp;rsquo;s. So less of the Perregrin/Pyro side of the lineage, more of the WC Arlo combined with Zava is what she brings to the table.&#xA;Mena</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our female from Jack x Mavokely, and our male from Colorado Chameleons, F1 Manjaka. Manjaka was pretty unassuming as a juvenile, but he became one of our favorite YBBB Ambilobe breeders as an adult. He had an extra blue bar, and yellows were classic Ambilobe. Mavokely came to us from Bobby Ruddock and she brings some of my favorite YBBB Ambilobe genetics - Amarillo.&#xA;Hatch dates 7/26/22 - 8/20/2022 Hatch rate 8/18 F1</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our F1 sire from Colorado Chameleons, Manjaka, and our female from Chromatic Chameleons, Lokana. Lokana is a mix of Chromatic and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Manjaka is a wonderful YBBB from a recent import, WC Arlo. The outcomes have been extremely consiste YBBB thus far which are not directly related to our main line of Ambilobe. They are a great option for people looking for high quality pairings with our multi-generational lines.</description>

      <description>Ranoka is a really interesting mix of F1 Manjaka and Kromatisk, Lokana&amp;rsquo;s sire. He has the radiant yellow that Manjaka has, but he also has the red embers at the edge of the yellow like Kromatisk - this almost looks orange at times and gives it an almost 3D look against a blue background. Really unique animal!&#xA;Ranoka&#xA;Ranoka1&#xA;Ranoka2&#xA;Ranoka3&#xA;Ranoka4&#xA;Ranoka5&#xA;Ranoka6&#xA;Ranoka7&#xA;Ranoka8&#xA;Filial F2-CG14 Sire Manjaka Dam Lokana 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Tsara Tarehy means attractive in Malagasy. We named the two sisters from Manjaka x Lokana Tsara and Tarehy :). Check out that clutch to see how consistent their YBBB phenotypes were. It is a very good proxy for what these two sisters bring to the table: great yellows and bars that shift from Landy to Manjaka&amp;rsquo;s blues. Very good complement to our existing lines!&#xA;Tsara&#xA;Tsara1&#xA;Tsara2&#xA;Filial F2-CG14 Sire Manjaka Dam Lokana 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Manjaya s Manjaka&amp;rsquo;s sister and she brings fresh genetics from a new WC sire, Arlo, who was acclimated by Chris Neeley at Colorado Chameleon. Arlo has a distinct look with red sprinkled on blue bars and a nice yellow body. Very cool Ambilobe import and one of the nicer ybbb with red highlights to come in the past few years. We are very lucky to have the opportunity to work with his daughters!</description>
