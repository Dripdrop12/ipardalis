      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in October 2023.&#xA;WC Haiyang came in with some face injuries which make him less likely to get the glam shots on social media; however, we are incredibly happy with him from a genetics and breeding standpoint. His blue bars are the best of all of our WC imports from One World Exotica and his body is very nice as well - green/yellow and only some very sparce red/orange markings.</description>
