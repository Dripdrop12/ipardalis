      <description>Zor is a great YBBB we produced with our Kammerflage male from Gold Rush named Zozoro. We paired him to our gorgeous female from Arti x Alla, Artalla. He brings some great baby blue bars and a lime green to yellow body. We only paired him a few times before letting him go to his forever home.&#xA;Zor&#xA;Zor1&#xA;Zor2&#xA;Zor3&#xA;Zor4&#xA;Zor5&#xA;Zor6&#xA;Zor7&#xA;Zor8&#xA;Filial F4-CG14 Sire Zozoro Dam Artalla 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Avana has some great Kammerflage Kreations lineage from her sire, Zozoro, and her dam, Artalla. All of her brothers had yellow bodies and a few had deep blue bars. It will be a lot of fun to prove her out with Zandrin - hoping for those blue bars!&#xA;Avana&#xA;Avana1&#xA;Avana2&#xA;Filial F4-CG14 Sire Zozoro Dam Artalla 5 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Avana (F4-CG14) Generation 1 1.

      <description>This pairing was between our only female from Arti x Alla, and our male from Kammerflage Kreations, Zozoro. Zozoro brings some nice yellow and blue. His yellow settled into a lime green at rest and his bars were more baby blue than royal blue. Whereas Arti had some great deep blue bars and bit less yellow in the body. This has a lot of Kammerflage on each side of the lineage and it is unrelated to our main line.</description>

      <description>Zozoro is a great YBBB from the Kammerflage sire Gold Rush. His father is my favorite YBBB produced over the past few years and his mother is the combination of a vibrant YBBB named My Friend and a true F1 from two different WC that the Kammer&amp;rsquo;s acclimated recently. Very excited to work this guy into our 4th/5th generation of Ambilobe!&#xA;Zozoro&#xA;Zozoro1&#xA;Zozoro2&#xA;Zozoro3&#xA;Zozoro4&#xA;Zozoro5&#xA;Filial F3-CG13 Sire Au-Mirongatra (Gold Rush) Dam Ankoso-Bolamena (Goldie) 5 Generation Tree</description>
