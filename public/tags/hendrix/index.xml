      <description>This pairing was between our fourth generation hold back, Jackson, and our female from Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics, Imelda. Imelda is a great mix of WC Gambit lines and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Jackson is the most vibrant male from our Jack x Mavokely clutch. We will definitely keep this line in our project in the years to come!&#xA;Hatch dates 7/14/2022 - 8/16/2022 Hatch rate 29/38 F1</description>

      <description>Pepita is a great 5th gen YBBB from our Papafee x Coco pairing. She only had 3 brothers, and at least one looked a lot like the Landy side of Coco&amp;rsquo;s lineage. Therefore, my expectation is that Pepita will throw Papafee or Landy looks. It will be a lot of fun to see what she does for us. She definitely resembles Coco more than Papafee&amp;rsquo;s dam, Sunny.&#xA;Pepita&#xA;Pepita1</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our fourth generation hold back, Papafee, and our little Ambilobe female from Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics, Coco. Coco is from a great pairing between Hendrix and Foxey. Hendrix brings a new WC Ambilobe line into the project and Foxey is from one of my favorite ybbb combinations from Kammerflage Kreations. Papafee is the HB male from our Zanaka x Sunny clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the fourth generation.</description>

      <description>Jimanga is one of our 5th gen Ambilobe breeders. He comes from our Manga x Imelda pairing, a great collab with Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics. I can trace his personality all the way back to Kako. They teach you that chameleons are a look-but-don&amp;rsquo;t-touch pet, the hard way haha&amp;hellip; but what comes with that is an absolutely amazing defense display. Definitely something I really enjoy about these guys!&#xA;Jimanga&#xA;Jimanga1&#xA;Jimanga2</description>

      <description>Jimelda is Jimanga&amp;rsquo;s sister from our Manga x Imelda pairing. She has some wonderful purples and a fiesty attitude! Manga was one of our best ybbb of all time, so we are really hoping Jimelda carries some of those traits into an F1 gen with WC Bibi. Those could very well be some of the best in the country if they prove out.&#xA;Jimelda&#xA;Jimelda1&#xA;Jimelda2&#xA;Jimelda3&#xA;Jimelda4&#xA;Filial F4-CG14 Sire Manga Dam Imelda 5 Generation Tree</description>

Imelda is a great mix of WC Gambit lines and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Manga is the male with the most striking yellows from our Bleu x Patch clutch. We kept Jimanga from this group and he has his father&amp;rsquo;s wonderful profile! Just a gorgeous group of Ambilobe.&#xA;Hatch dates 12/03/2021 - 2/19/2022 Hatch rate 15/19 M1</description>

      <description>Coco brings a new WC line from Brightside Chameleon&amp;rsquo;s Gambit into our project via Hendrix/Dante from Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics! Hendrix is a great mix of two recent WC sires, Gambit and Bolt, and we are very excited to add his daughter to our breeding group. She has phenomenal coloring for a female and has been able to lay and bounce back easily thus far. Very healthy girl!&#xA;Coco&#xA;Coco1&#xA;Coco2</description>

Hendrix is a great mix of two recent WC sires, Gambit and Bolt, and we are very excited to add his daughter to our breeding group. She layed successfully, but we have been monitoring a minor gular edema on her. We adjusted her supplementation and feeding schedule. Hopefully, it clears up in no time.</description>
