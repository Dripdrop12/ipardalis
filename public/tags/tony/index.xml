      <description>Teny is a beautiful female Ambilobe panther chameleon who we produced with Tony and Paige. Her sire had nice deep blue bars like his dam sire, Artemis with a clean yellow body like Nugget. Her dam brings a great Tropical Chameleons x Modern Day Dragons YBBB lineage from Tiffany Mallay.&#xA;Teny&#xA;Teny1&#xA;Teny2&#xA;Filial F5-CG14 Sire Tony Dam Paige 5 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Teny (F5-CG14) Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>Tony one of our 4th generation YBBB Ambilobe. He has some great traits from his dam, Amara, like his deep blue bars and red highlights, but he also has some vibrant yellows from his sire, Nugget. His profile is one of my favorites with striking turret and gular lines. We are very lucky to have him in our breeding group!&#xA;Tony&#xA;Tony1&#xA;Tony2&#xA;Tony3&#xA;Tony4&#xA;Tony5&#xA;Tony6&#xA;Tony7&#xA;Tony8</description>
