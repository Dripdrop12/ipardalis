      <description>This pairing was between our forth generation hold back, Ralph, and our female from Nature&amp;rsquo;s Van Gogh, Mainty. Mainty has a few rainbow brothers and a few RBBB brothers, so it will be fun to see which side she brings here. We paired Mainty with Kosmo after she had an infertile clutch after Ralph. We will probably not keep any of these wonderful animals because of our long-term plans for Mainty.</description>

      <description>Ralph is a great 4th generation continuation of the Alfred line with vibrant blues and reds! Alfred was an odd ball from our Jude x Alla pairing, so these red-heavy Ambilobe are not closely related to many of the other red Ambilobe out there. We plan to keep him paired to one or two females and only do a few clutches with this fun side project.&#xA;Ralph&#xA;Ralph1&#xA;Ralph2</description>
