      <description>Kintana is a line-bred YBBB from Chromatic Chameleons from Capella and Kromatisk. Capella is one of our favorite sires they have produced over the past few years, and Kromatisk is easily one of our favorites over the past decade. We have a decent amount of Felipe Sanchez and JJ/Kromatisk in our existing lines, so we will do our best to avoid those as long as we can. Otherwise, she should bring some more solid genetics from one of the best Ambilobe projects in the USA over at Chromatic Chameleons.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our F1 sire from Colorado Chameleons, Manjaka, and our female from Chromatic Chameleons, Lokana. Lokana is a mix of Chromatic and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Manjaka is a wonderful YBBB from a recent import, WC Arlo. The outcomes have been extremely consiste YBBB thus far which are not directly related to our main line of Ambilobe. They are a great option for people looking for high quality pairings with our multi-generational lines.</description>

      <description>Ranoka is a really interesting mix of F1 Manjaka and Kromatisk, Lokana&amp;rsquo;s sire. He has the radiant yellow that Manjaka has, but he also has the red embers at the edge of the yellow like Kromatisk - this almost looks orange at times and gives it an almost 3D look against a blue background. Really unique animal!&#xA;Ranoka&#xA;Ranoka1&#xA;Ranoka2&#xA;Ranoka3&#xA;Ranoka4&#xA;Ranoka5&#xA;Ranoka6&#xA;Ranoka7&#xA;Ranoka8&#xA;Filial F2-CG14 Sire Manjaka Dam Lokana 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Tsara Tarehy means attractive in Malagasy. We named the two sisters from Manjaka x Lokana Tsara and Tarehy :). Check out that clutch to see how consistent their YBBB phenotypes were. It is a very good proxy for what these two sisters bring to the table: great yellows and bars that shift from Landy to Manjaka&amp;rsquo;s blues. Very good complement to our existing lines!&#xA;Tsara&#xA;Tsara1&#xA;Tsara2&#xA;Filial F2-CG14 Sire Manjaka Dam Lokana 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Mami is one of our 5th generation HB females from Papafee x Lokana. She has more purples and pinks like her mother, Lokana, whereas her two sisters Vaosary and Bumble Bee remind me of their aunts, Papafee&amp;rsquo;s sisters. Her first pairing is with our new WC Ambilobe, so we expect her to produce some absolutely amazing F1 YBBB Ambilobe for us!&#xA;Mami&#xA;Mami1&#xA;Mami2&#xA;Filial F4-CG14 Sire Papafee Dam Lokana 5 Generation Tree</description>

His attitude is a bit more feisty than his father, but he&amp;rsquo;s calming down a bit now as he reaches adulthood.

Lokana is from a great pairing between Kromatisk and Shirley. Kromatisk is one of my favorite Ambilobe breeders in the USA and Shirley is from one of my favorite ybbb combinations from Kammerflage Kreations. Papafee is the HB male from our Zanaka x Sunny clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the fourth generation.</description>

      <description>Noko is our HB female from Nugget and Loko. Her brother is Zandrin. She should throw some intense yellow and blue with some interesting red highlighting. Her personality is very calm and photogenic.

      <description>Lokana is the half-sister of Loko. They each have a 50% chance of bringing Kromatisk&amp;rsquo;s amazing ybbb into our project, but Lokana also has Landy x Hamy from her dam, Shirley&amp;rsquo;s side. Really can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with the two possibilities here. We are very excited to see how she proves out over the years :).&#xA;Lokana&#xA;mtDNA Haplogroup* 3 (Ambilobe East) Filial F9-CG13 Sire Kromatisk Dam Shirley *preliminary results</description>

      <description>Loko is a premium CB Ambilobe from some of the best lines in the USA. Her sire, Kromatisk from Chromatic Chameleons, is one of my favorite active breeders of the locale.
