      <title>WC Bibi x Mamony</title>

      <description>This pairing is a great F1 group with WC Bibi paired to our 4th gen female named Mamony from Blossom x Maitso. Our hope is that the strong blues on the female side of this lineage will help clean up the mixed bar look of WC Bibi and he&amp;rsquo;ll bring some size and fresh genetics into the mix. WC Bibi&amp;rsquo;s yellows are very interesting and slightly different from Blossom&amp;rsquo;s, so it will also be interesting to watch these animals as they mature.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our male named Kiborin from Blossom x Maitso, and a female we picked up from Brian Stewart, Maize. Maize seems to be throwing everything from a beautiful orange body blue bar to a yellow body blue bar while Kiborin was one of our favorite yellow body blue bars from Blossom. This group has been very vibrant and a few males have had the ability to fire up to to point where their blue bars almost go white!</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our third generation hold back, Blossom, and our female from Bobby Ruddock, Mavokely. Mavokely is from one of our favorite yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe, Amarillo, and Blossom is the HB male from our Jude x Alla clutch. Great combination of colorful ybbb and clean yellows!&#xA;Blossom x Mavokely Hatch dates 6/20/2021 - 6/24/2021 Hatch rate 22/22 F1&#xA;F2&#xA;M2&#xA;M3&#xA;M4&#xA;Hatch dates 8/08/2021 - 8/22/2021 Hatch rate 23/26 F1</description>

      <description>Kiborin is our 4th gen HB from Blossom x Maitso. He is Blaitso&amp;rsquo;s brother. These two are just amazing animals and we are excited to see Kiborin&amp;rsquo;s clean yellow with blue. He has less red highlighting that his father and a really clean look!&#xA;Kiborin&#xA;Kiborin1&#xA;Kiborin2&#xA;Kiborin3&#xA;Kiborin4&#xA;Filial F4-CG13 Sire Blossom Dam Maitso 5 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Kiborin (F4-CG13) Generation 1 1.

      <description>Mamony is a nice 4th gen female from our Blossom x Maitso. She resembles Blossom&amp;rsquo;s dam, Alla, more than she resembles her own dam, Maitso. I have a theory that those are hints about which side of the tree a female takes after, so check for Blossom-like offspring from Mamony!&#xA;Mamony&#xA;Mamony1&#xA;Mamony2&#xA;Filial F4-CG13 Sire Blossom Dam Maitso 5 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Mamony (F4-CG13) Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>Blaitso is a drop dead gorgeous 4th gen female from our Blossom x Maitso. She has vibrant oranges, a great bar/body contrast and teal cheeks. Her lineage is also amazing so she will be fun to watch!

      <description>We got lucky holding back Blossom from Jude x Alla. He looks like a mini-JJ, Alla&amp;rsquo;s sire, and is a key member of our 3rd generation breeding group. His personality is very similar to Alla&amp;rsquo;s in that he is very bold and rarely defensive. His yellows are bright and his colors are very vibrant. I could not be happier with how he has turned out!&#xA;Blossom&#xA;Blossom1&#xA;Blossom2&#xA;Blossom3</description>

      <description>Alla is our most successful female breeder to date. She has a gregarious personality and brings some of the nicest YBBB Kammerflage Kreations lineage into our project via her sire, JJ. We were very lucky to pick her up from Panther Creek Chameleons back in 2017 before JJ was sold to Chromatic Chameleons.&#xA;Alla&#xA;Alla1&#xA;Alla2&#xA;Filial F8-CG11 Sire JJ Dam Blue Bird&amp;rsquo;s Daughter 5 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Alla Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>Jude was the alpha male from Flash and Judy&amp;rsquo;s clutch, hatched 10/17/17. He has strong yellows and a fierce attitude! We were lucky to select a male that looks a lot like his grandfather, Cowboy. He has now sired the majority of our babies and we will breed him sparingly moving forward.&#xA;Body shot&#xA;Dsc00380&#xA;Dsc00383&#xA;Jude&#xA;Jude2&#xA;Filial Group F2 Sire Flash Dam Judy 4 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Jude (F2) Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>Flash was our first generation breeder from Cowboy (CH) at Chameleon&amp;rsquo;s Paradise. He had a very gentle personality and only gave us one healthy clutch with Judy, from which we kept Jude. We were still learning when we got Flash and he passed after consuming a large number of wild bugs when pesticides had been applied to the lawn behind ours. The vet said that he had kidney failure like he&amp;rsquo;d been poisoned, but we have been continuing to improve our husbandry year-after-year in his honor.</description>
