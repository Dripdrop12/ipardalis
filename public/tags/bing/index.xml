      <description>Great little girl we got from Frank Payne. I am a huge fan of her shoulder patches and her night sky pattern on the dark body sections. Her older sister, Violet, was our first female; however, we have not gotten any clutches from her yet. Bing is a sweetheart, and we hope to hatch our first clutches from her in 2021!
