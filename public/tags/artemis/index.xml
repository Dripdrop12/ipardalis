      <description>This pairing was between our our 4th gen HB from Nugget x Amara, Tony, and our female from Tiffany Mallay, Paige. Paige has great potential from Ambilobe lines from Tropical Chameleons and Modern Day Dragons, and Tony is the spitting image of his dam sire, Artemis, with a little extra yellow from Nugget. These guys hatched out strong and we&amp;rsquo;re hoping to do an encore pairing with Zandrin next year.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between one of our F1 females from Colorado Chameleon, Manjalla, and our male from Brian Stewart, Arti. They both come from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations. The clutch was small and Manjalla was very weak, so we were only able to keep one baby alive from this group.&#xA;Hatch dates 8/19/2022 - 8/20/2022 Hatch rate 2/17 M1</description>

      <description>Artilly is a great YBBB from our Arti x Lilly pairing. Arti is one of our favorite ybbb breeders who we mixed in at the 3rd gen and Lilly is a female from our Jude x Kako group. We did not get too many examples from the small clutch that produced her, so it will be a lot of fun to prove her out!&#xA;Artilly&#xA;Artilly1&#xA;Artilly2&#xA;Filial F4-CG13 Sire Arti Dam Lilly 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Squash is a great YBBB Ambilobe female from our good friend Brian Stewart. McNulty is a male from one of Brian&amp;rsquo;s old projects from the Stryfe line and he paired him up with a female from one of his recent pairings with Artemis from Colorado Chameleons. These should be a lot of fun to prove out because they have three ybbb sires in the closest lineage. Top notch stuff as always!</description>

      <description>Ghost is a 4th gen ybbb Ambilobe breeder here at iPardalis. He is from our Arti and Daisy pairing. His yellows are so light when he fires up that we decided to name him Ghost. They are just so clean and bright! There is also an H bar on his right side. We are very excited to have him carry the torch on this part of our tree.&#xA;Ghost</description>

      <description>Dehibe is a great YBBB Ambilobe we produced with Arti and Alla. He brings some great blue bars and a yellow body, very similar to his sire. He and his sister, Artalla, were the only two babies to survive Alla&amp;rsquo;s last clutch, and they are very special to us. This is a great cb combination without any of our main line in it.&#xA;Dehibe&#xA;Dehibe1&#xA;Dehibe2&#xA;Dehibe3&#xA;Dehibe4&#xA;Dehibe5</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our most prolific female from Panther Creek Chameleons, Alla, and our male from Brian Stewart, Arti. Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Alla is a wonderful female from JJ who was produced by Kammerflage Kreations. We only had a single clutch from these two because it was towards the end of Alla&amp;rsquo;s breeding career.&#xA;Arti x Alla Hatch dates 10/15/2021 - 10/19/2021 Hatch rate 3/20 Dehibe</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our first captive hatched (CH) female, Bohana, and our male from Brian Stewart, Arti. Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Bohana is a female Ambilobe hatched out by Busy B&amp;rsquo;s Exotics from a wild caught imported female. Bohana&amp;rsquo;s wild genes didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to add much to our project when combined with Arti, so we did not keep any of these animals.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our third generation hold back, Nugget, and our female from Brian Stewart, Amara. Amara proved out to carry a lot of her sire&amp;rsquo;s, Artemis&amp;rsquo;, traits like his dark blue bars and red highlighting. Nugget is the HB male from our Jude x Kako clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the third generation. This was a great combination of colorful ybbb with both blue bars and clean yellows!</description>

      <description>Tiger Lilly is one of the most stunning females I have seen in person. She has an amazing bar/body contrast, organge highlights in her face and turrets and an orang glow on her arms and tail. We are very lucky to get to work with her. Hopefully, those traits are a sign that she is as cool as her sire, Nugget.&#xA;Tigerlilly&#xA;Tigerlilly1&#xA;Tigerlilly2&#xA;Tigerlilly3&#xA;Tigerlilly4&#xA;Tigerlilly5&#xA;Filial F4-CG13 Sire Nugget Dam Amara 5 Generation Tree</description>

      <description>Tony one of our 4th generation YBBB Ambilobe. He has some great traits from his dam, Amara, like his deep blue bars and red highlights, but he also has some vibrant yellows from his sire, Nugget. His profile is one of my favorites with striking turret and gular lines. We are very lucky to have him in our breeding group!&#xA;Tony&#xA;Tony1&#xA;Tony2&#xA;Tony3&#xA;Tony4&#xA;Tony5&#xA;Tony6&#xA;Tony7&#xA;Tony8</description>

      <description>Amara is Arti&amp;rsquo;s sister from the Kammerflage Fantara line produced by Brian Stewart in partnership with Colorado Chameleons. It will be interesting to compare her offspring with Arti&amp;rsquo;s to figure out which traits she is carrying from their shared lineage. I have always been curious about the females role in breeding and I think it is the key to producing some extraordinary animals.&#xA;Amara&#xA;Amara1&#xA;Amara2&#xA;Filial F3-CG12 Sire Artemis Dam Felipe Sanchez&amp;rsquo;s daughter 5 Generation Tree</description>
