      <description>Great little girl we got from Frank Payne. I am a huge fan of her shoulder patches and her night sky pattern on the dark body sections. Her older sister, Violet, was our first female; however, we have not gotten any clutches from her yet. Bing is a sweetheart, and we hope to hatch our first clutches from her in 2021!</description>

      <description>Beautiful female that we picked up from Kevin Stanford. She has a really nice pitch-black body with a fire tip on the top of her yellow streaks. Stunning specimen of this species! We were able to get a few healthy clutches from her and hope to produce our first clutch from them.</description>
