      <description>Panther Chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) display an amazing variety of colors within distinct locales that are physically separated by mountains, oceans, rivers and mangrove forests. The Panther Chameleon hobby has never had a reliable way to test animals for locale origin, and we have had to rely on import labels, guessing locale based off of male phenotypes, or what the breeder one gen upstream said. However, females do not display their phenotype and have always been “proven out” by breeding with a male from an assumed locale and observing their offspring to determine if they look like we would expect.</description>
