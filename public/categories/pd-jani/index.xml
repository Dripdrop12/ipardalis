      <description>We have a small breeding group of &amp;lsquo;18 and &amp;lsquo;19 Pituophis deppei jani (Northern Mexican Pine Snakes). They are a beautiful big-bodied Pituophis species that start out &amp;ldquo;ugly,&amp;rdquo; brown and tan. They are highly variable, and as they age, their colors become more distinct. Many animals develop an orange head and tail. Their back saddle markings wash out in the middle and are crisp near the extremities. They can grow to be up to 9&amp;rsquo; long and are thicker than most colubrids.</description>
