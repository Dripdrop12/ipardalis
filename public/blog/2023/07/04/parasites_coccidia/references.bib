  abstract = {Reptiles and amphibians are becoming increasingly more common in the exotic pet trade and as such veterinary care is also rising. Parasitic infections can pose a serious threat to pet reptiles and amphibians and are a common finding in these exotic pets. The purpose of the present study was to determine the species composition of parasites among reptiles and amphibians entering the pet industry. Excreta were collected from 283 reptiles and amphibians (181 geckos, 23 chameleons, 21 frogs, 16 tortoises, 11 snakes, 1 caiman, and 31 other lizard species), representing 58 different species. Samples were collected from animals being sold at exotic pet shows in Texas, USA, where breeders from throughout the United States gathered to showcase their exotic pets. Excreta samples were tested using double centrifugation flotation with Sheather's sucrose solution. Endoparasites were identified in 51.9\% of samples. The most prevalent helminth parasite among reptiles and amphibians were Pharyngodonidae (44.5\%) nematodes. Oocysts of coccidians such as Isospora, Eimeria, and Choleoeimeria, and cysts of the ciliate Nyctotherus were also identified. The prevalence rates of endoparasites among animal groups ranged from 0 to 87.5\%. The highest prevalence of infection was found in Testudines (87.5\%), followed by Chamaeleonidae (87\%), other lizards (76.7\%), Amphibia (71.4\%), Serpentes (63.6\%), and then Gekkonidae (55.2\%). No endoparasites were detected in the one Crocodylia sampled. Our results show that parasitic infections, many of which can cause clinical disease and mortality, are common in exotic reptiles and amphibians being sold or traded as pets in the United States, underlining the need for veterinary care and routine diagnostic screening for parasitic infections.},

  abstract = {Tetrasporocystic, dizoic oocysts of reptiles have been separated by some authors into the genera Eimeria, Choleoeimeria and Acroeimeria (Protozoa: Eimeriidae), based on the site and mode of development of their endogenous stages. The majority of Eimeria species have been, and still are, however, described on oocyst morphology alone. Four different oocysts with this basic morphology were encountered in the faeces of Brazilian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria Spix, 1824 and are assigned to the genus Eimeria, with the view that they can readily be transferred to the genus Choleoeimeria or Acroeimeria if this is indicated by a future examination of their endogenous development. A morphological comparison distinguishes the oocysts from those of Eimeria spp., previously described in chelonids of the family Testudinidae, and the names E. amazonensis, E. carbonaria, E. carajasensis and E. wellcomei n. spp. are proposed. Coccidial infection appears to be common in G. carbonaria, with three of seven animals examined passing oocysts. Oocysts of Isospora rodriguesae n. sp. (Protozoa: Eimeriidae) are described in the faeces of Geochelone denticulata Linnaeus, 1766. They are morphologically very different from those of Isospora testudae, Davronov, 1985 in Testudo horsfieldi. Eimeria motelo H\r{u}rkov\'a et al., 2000, previously described in Geochelone denticulata from Peru, is here recorded in the some chelonid from Amazonian Brazil.},

In this regard, the purpose of research was to confirm or refute the theory, in reptiles from different places of residence, various parasites are found. We studied panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) imported from the wild and raised in captivity. To determine the parasites in the laboratory, methods of native smear, sequential washing and flotation were used. 10 species of intestinal parasites were found in panther chameleons imported from the wild, in particular Trematoda gen. sp. 1, Tremaitoda gen. sp. 2, Cestoda gen. sp., Spinicauda freitasi (Olfers, 1919), Hexametra angusticaecoides (Chabaud et Brygoo, 1960), Pharyngodonidae gen. sp., spirurates of the genus Thubunaea sp., larvae of the family Rhabdiasidae gen. sp., flagellates from the series Kinetoplastida gen. sp. and Eimeria sp, with prevalence 87.56\%. In panther chameleons grown in captivity only Pharyngodonidae gen. sp. was found, prevalence was 94.05\%. It is noted that under appropriate conditions of keeping and feeding in captive panther chameleons, a small number of parasites with a direct development cycle and their insignificant toxic effect on the body can develop}
