  abstract = {Having previously documented experimentally the need for ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (290\textendash 315 nm) in the light environment of captive female panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) to ensure hatching success of their eggs, we investigated optimal UVB irradiation levels. From 1996\textendash 1998 28 hatchling female panther chameleons were raised to maturity and bred (using vitamin and mineral-fortified insect diets low in vitamin D) in nine different artificial UVB light environments. Seven of the environments included long (12 hr/day) low irradia-tion exposures ranging from 1.7 to 22 {$\mu$}W/cm2 UVB, with a corresponding conversion of provitamin D3 to photoproducts in in vitro models of 0.18 to 1.52\% in 2 hr. Two environments included short (0.5 and 1.0 hr/day), high irradiation exposures of 55 and 49 {$\mu$}W/cm2 UVB, respectively, with a corres-ponding conversion of provitamin D3 to photoproducts in in vitro models of 8.3\% to 14.6\% in the respective 0.5- and 1.0-hr time periods. Females raised with the mid-level long/low exposures (5\textendash 15 {$\mu$}W/cm2 UVB; 0.52\textendash 1.32\% conversion to photoproducts in in vitro models) produced viable eggs with a significantly higher percentage of hatching compared to those with the extreme (highest or lowest) long/low exposures. Those raised with the short-/high-exposure environments produced viable eggs with a generally high percentage of hatching, but success was variable. The results and techniques for light quality assessment are interpreted, with recommendations for practical application by the herpetoculturist desiring to successfully breed panther chameleons in captivity.

  abstract = {To assess the importance of diet and light for indoor maintenance, hatchling panther chameleons were reared for 1 year on crickets fed diets that differed in vitamin concentrations and in different light environments. Dietary transfer of vitamins from the cricket diet to the lizards via the crickets was quantified, as was UV irradiance. There was a statistically significant dietary enhancement of growth by both vitamins on males. UV-A irradiation significantly suppressed growth of females. Low vitamin A shortened life span and resulted in a number of gross and histological pathologies. Hepatocellular lipidosis, indicating a possible toxicosis, occurred with all diets and light treatments. Higher vitamin A resulted in mild soft-tissue mineralization, and high vitamin D shortened the life span of females. Low vitamin A drastically reduced reproduction in both sexes. The intermediate levels of dietary vitamins resulted in the best production of viable eggs by females. However, without high UV-B irradiation, all viable eggs died at term and contained different vitamin levels than hatching eggs from wild-caught females. Baseline levels of egg calcium are given for hatching eggs from wild-caught females. Modifications in current husbandry procedures are recommended. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Basking by ectothermic vertebrates is thought to have evolved for thermoregulation. However, another beneficial effect of sunlight exposure, specifically the ultraviolet B (UV-B) component, includes endogenous production of vitamin D3. In the laboratory, panther chameleons exhibited a positive phototaxis to greater visible, ultraviolet A (UV-A) and UV-B light. However, with equivalent high irradiances of UV-A or UV-B, their response to UV-B was significantly greater than it was to UV-A. Exposure of in vitro skin patches of panther chameleons to high UV-B (90 mW/cm2) for 1 h significantly enhanced vitamin D3 concentration. Voluntary exposure to higher UV-B irradiance (70 vs. 1 mW/cm2) resulted in greater circulating 25hydroxyvitamin D3 in female panther chameleons (604 vs. 92 ng/mL). Depending on dietary intake of vitamin D3, chameleons adjusted their exposure time to UV-B irradiation as if regulating their endogenous production of this vital hormone. When dietary intake was low (1\textendash 3 IU/g), they exposed themselves to significantly more UV-producing light; when intake was high (9\textendash 129 IU/g), they exposed themselves to less. Vitamin D3 photoregulation seems to be an important additional component of the function of basking.},

  abstract = {Reptiles may bask for reasons other than thermoregulation. One alternative is to regulate homeostasis of vitamin D3, a hormone essential to the health of many reptiles. Maintenance of vitamin D3 homeostasis requires either regulation of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) or ingested vitamin D3. However, the prey items of most vertebrates tend to be low in vitamin D3. Thus, basking may be the primary opportunity for vitamin D3 regulation. We tested the hypothesis that panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) behaviorally regulate exposure to UV in natural sunlight with high precision, accuracy, and effectiveness. Panther chameleons with low dietary vitamin D3 intake significantly increased exposure to UV in natural sunlight compared to those with high dietary vitamin D3 intake. All lizards fed low dietary vitamin D3 regulated within optimal UV levels with extreme effectiveness (ability to regulate within optimal UV levels relative to available UV). Chameleons of both dietary treatments regulated UV exposure with great precision, exhibiting little variation among individuals within treatments. Our results add to a growing body of literature that empirically demonstrates the importance of basking for nonthermoregulatory purposes and, more specifically, as an integral mechanism for the regulation of a vital hormone, vitamin D3.},
