      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in October 2023.&#xA;WC Taiyang and WC Haiyang are two of my favorite wild caught imports; Taiyang means sun in Chinese because he has a ton of yellow w/ a little mix of orange like the sun, and Haiyang means sea/ocean in Chinese. Haiyang&amp;rsquo;s blue bars are really something for a WC, so we have the sun (Taiyang) and the sea (Haiyang). They both came in great condition, and I hope to be working with them for years to come.</description>

      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in October 2023.&#xA;WC Haiyang came in with some face injuries which make him less likely to get the glam shots on social media; however, we are incredibly happy with him from a genetics and breeding standpoint. His blue bars are the best of all of our WC imports from One World Exotica and his body is very nice as well - green/yellow and only some very sparce red/orange markings.</description>

      <description>This pairing is a great F1 group with WC Bibi paired to our 4th gen female named Mamony from Blossom x Maitso. Our hope is that the strong blues on the female side of this lineage will help clean up the mixed bar look of WC Bibi and he&amp;rsquo;ll bring some size and fresh genetics into the mix. WC Bibi&amp;rsquo;s yellows are very interesting and slightly different from Blossom&amp;rsquo;s, so it will also be interesting to watch these animals as they mature.</description>

      <description>Executive Summary Coccidia Basics Structure Life Cycle Known Species Isospora brygooi Choleoeimeria glawi Eimeria vencesi Discussion Reference TL;DR&#xA;This article examines three of species of Coccidia which are known to infect Furcifer pardalis and poses a theory that Choleoeimeria glawi (FigureÂ 3) are more likely to cause serious illness based on extant literature and our experience. More clinical research is warranted because we are not specialists in parasitology or veterinary microbiology, and we did not attempt to bifurcate our clinical results by Coccidia species.</description>

      <description>This pairing was the only successful clutch with WC Dia. We paired him to our 5th gen female named Vaosary from Papafee x Lokana. Vaosary was a stand out female with a lot of orange from one of my favorite 5th gen groups. Because of how rare this line will be, they are a great option for breeders looking for high-quality foundation animals at the F1 generation. Really love that we got some WC Dia and Papafee clones in the mix here - very cool stuff!</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our 5th gen male named Jimanga from Manga x Imelda, and a 5th gen female named Bumble Bee from Papafee x Lokana. This is the combination of two of our favorite lines and the culmination of years of selective breeding for yellow body blue bar traits. If they don&amp;rsquo;t prove out, we have no one to blame but ourselves! ;)&#xA;Hatch dates 6/28/23 - 7/10/23 Hatch rate 23/26 M1</description>

      <description>We have taken a strong public stance against the sale of panther chameleon eggs. This post will summarize our points and provide a single source of information on our work on this topic. If you have seen us on Facebook or another forum fighting the good fight, this is why.&#xA;Panther Chameleons are not easy reptiles to keep in captivity. They are an arboreal species with specific conditions which require constant maintenance.</description>

      <description>This is a discussion about whether breeders should get a pass for poor husbandry. We know that the practical constraints of breeding animals for a profit yields a compromising attitude towards husbandry. I believe it should be uncompromising, and I am happy to hold myself to the same standards as my customers. Bill is a leader in this movement and I hope we can encourage more breeders to commit to higher standards of care.</description>

      <description>Ryan and Mitch are two breeders who I have a long history with. We met on social media when I got started in the hobby in 2015-2016. We have had late-night discussions on all sorts of drama, challenges, and much needed breeder therapy sessions. Mitch was a major sponsor of the panther chameleon local form genetic test. He creates some crazy cool cross-locale and pure locale panther chameleons, and Ryan started a podcast recently but I knew him from his Cap Est project - which is to-date the best I have seen.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our male named Kiborin from Blossom x Maitso, and a female we picked up from Brian Stewart, Maize. Maize seems to be throwing everything from a beautiful orange body blue bar to a yellow body blue bar while Kiborin was one of our favorite yellow body blue bars from Blossom. This group has been very vibrant and a few males have had the ability to fire up to to point where their blue bars almost go white!</description>

We were honored to speak with him after he fired an ethical shot across the bow of herpetoculture.&#xA;Care of the animal comes first - business comes second Over production and a breeder&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to market their work Egg sales Group raising vs individual-raising Breeding vs flipping Genetics - polygenic traits and selective breeding Wild caught and importation Parasites and captive health management strategies </description>

      <description>This pairing was between our only female from Arti x Alla, and our male from Kammerflage Kreations, Zozoro. Zozoro brings some nice yellow and blue. His yellow settled into a lime green at rest and his bars were more baby blue than royal blue. Whereas Arti had some great deep blue bars and bit less yellow in the body. This has a lot of Kammerflage on each side of the lineage and it is unrelated to our main line.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our forth generation hold back, Ralph, and our female from Nature&amp;rsquo;s Van Gogh, Mainty. Mainty has a few rainbow brothers and a few RBBB brothers, so it will be fun to see which side she brings here. We paired Mainty with Kosmo after she had an infertile clutch after Ralph. We will probably not keep any of these wonderful animals because of our long-term plans for Mainty.</description>

Manjaka was pretty unassuming as a juvenile, but he became one of our favorite YBBB Ambilobe breeders as an adult. He had an extra blue bar, and yellows were classic Ambilobe.

      <description>We believe that sharing information about our experience with parasites will not only help our customers keep their animals healthy, but it could help build awareness and promote preventative actions throughout the industry. Our hope is that it will accomplish that goal and build stronger relationships with our customers. Eventually, it will result in long-term project sustainability and a stronger community of hobbyists.&#xA;Most people would not publish this story about parasites on their business page because most people are concerned about short-term revenue and less concerned about their integrity and animal welfare.</description>

      <description>The best Panther Chameleon breeders have a deep understanding of their genetics, inheritance patterns and can help you get what you want. This knowledge plays into the ethics of selling Panther Chameleons because there is a lot of false advertising in the industry which is very surface-level without much understanding of the species. This is our answer to the filtered images and click-bait on Instagram and TikTok.&#xA;Introduction Given that Panther Chameleon (Furcifer pardalis) colors are polygenic traits, and Panther Chameleons are a sexually dimorphic species, selective breeding for a given color is challenging and many breeders fail to achieve a consistent result.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between one of our F1 females from Colorado Chameleon, Manjalla, and our male from Brian Stewart, Arti. They both come from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations. The clutch was small and Manjalla was very weak, so we were only able to keep one baby alive from this group.&#xA;Hatch dates 8/19/2022 - 8/20/2022 Hatch rate 2/17 M1</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our fourth generation hold back, Jackson, and our female from Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics, Imelda. Imelda is a great mix of WC Gambit lines and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Jackson is the most vibrant male from our Jack x Mavokely clutch. We will definitely keep this line in our project in the years to come!&#xA;Hatch dates 7/14/2022 - 8/16/2022 Hatch rate 29/38 F1</description>

      <description>Kintana is a line-bred YBBB from Chromatic Chameleons from Capella and Kromatisk. Capella is one of our favorite sires they have produced over the past few years, and Kromatisk is easily one of our favorites over the past decade. We have a decent amount of Felipe Sanchez and JJ/Kromatisk in our existing lines, so we will do our best to avoid those as long as we can. Otherwise, she should bring some more solid genetics from one of the best Ambilobe projects in the USA over at Chromatic Chameleons.</description>

      <description>Mena is our HB from Zava and F1 Manjaya. Zava had a significant amount of red and a few of Mena&amp;rsquo;s brothers got it, too. Manjaya seems to have taken after her WC sire, Arlo. A few of Mena&amp;rsquo;s brothers looked like mini Arlo&amp;rsquo;s. So less of the Perregrin/Pyro side of the lineage, more of the WC Arlo combined with Zava is what she brings to the table.&#xA;Mena</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our female from Jack x Mavokely, and our male from Colorado Chameleons, F1 Manjaka. Manjaka was pretty unassuming as a juvenile, but he became one of our favorite YBBB Ambilobe breeders as an adult. He had an extra blue bar, and yellows were classic Ambilobe. Mavokely came to us from Bobby Ruddock and she brings some of my favorite YBBB Ambilobe genetics - Amarillo.&#xA;Hatch dates 7/26/22 - 8/20/2022 Hatch rate 8/18 F1</description>

      <description>This article describes how Panther Chameleons inherit their color over multiple generations. There are many myths in the industry related to what you can get from various Panther Chameleon pairings, and these misconceptions result in pricing issues and scams.&#xA;TLDR; Most individuals have multiple body colors because the complete absence of a color is extremely rare. If a color is found in that locale, you usually can find at least some of it somewhere on every individualâs body from that locale.</description>

      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in June 2022.&#xA;Bibi is a very vibrant wild caught (WC) Ambilobe panther chameleon. Bibidia translates to wild in Malagasy, which is why we named our two WC Bibi and Dia. Bibi has a decent amount of red on his face and blue bars with a vibrant green/yellow body. The yellow covers both his body and bars, so his bars almost look green at times.</description>

      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in June 2022.&#xA;Miafina is a wild caught (WC) Ambilobe Panther Chameleon. Miafina is derived from the Malagasy word for &amp;ldquo;mystery&amp;rdquo; because her phenotype is a complete mystery. We are very excited to prove her out with our WC Tratra who is an Ambilobe male without very much, if any, red highlighting. When we watch her sons develop, we&amp;rsquo;ll get an estimate for what she brings to the table besides fresh WC genetics!</description>

      <description>Imported by One World Exotica&#xA;Tratra is a classic wild caught (WC) Ambilobe panther chameleon. Tratra translates to &amp;ldquo;caught&amp;rdquo; in Malagasy, which complements our other two WC Bibi and WC Dia because bibidia translates to &amp;ldquo;wild&amp;rdquo; in Malagasy. After we failed to fully acclimate Dia, we decided to try again with Tratra. He has beautiful baby blue bars like our first CB holdback, Jude, and a nice consistent green body color.</description>

      <description>Imported by One World Exotica in June 2022.&#xA;Dia was our favorite WC import, between him and Bibi. He had a clean yellow body and his bars showed more blue as he settled in; however, he did not fully acclimate and we only got a few clutches from him. We did find him some top notch females from our line, so hopefully those great traits get worked into the gene pool!</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our F1 sire from Colorado Chameleons, Manjaka, and our female from Chromatic Chameleons, Lokana. Lokana is a mix of Chromatic and Kammerflage Kreations yellow-bodied blue bar Ambilobe while Manjaka is a wonderful YBBB from a recent import, WC Arlo. The outcomes have been extremely consiste YBBB thus far which are not directly related to our main line of Ambilobe. They are a great option for people looking for high quality pairings with our multi-generational lines.</description>

      <description>Ranoka is a really interesting mix of F1 Manjaka and Kromatisk, Lokana&amp;rsquo;s sire. He has the radiant yellow that Manjaka has, but he also has the red embers at the edge of the yellow like Kromatisk - this almost looks orange at times and gives it an almost 3D look against a blue background.

Check out that clutch to see how consistent their YBBB phenotypes were.

Her sire, Clapton, and dam sire, DynamiteTNT, both have phenomenal blue bars which I believe will complement Ralph&amp;rsquo;s really well. With any luck, a few Ralph clones could pop out because Robina is an RBBB x RBBB female. She has some interesting turquoise and subtle differences from most of my other females. She is awesome!&#xA;Robina</description>

When I heard the framing of this question on Bill&amp;rsquo;s podcast, I sent him a long message and he was kind enough to give me a chance to speak my mind.</description>

      <description>Panther Chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) display an amazing variety of colors within distinct locales that are physically separated by mountains, oceans, rivers and mangrove forests. The Panther Chameleon hobby has never had a reliable way to test animals for locale origin, and we have had to rely on import labels, guessing locale based off of male phenotypes, or what the breeder one gen upstream said. However, females do not display their phenotype and have always been âproven outâ by breeding with a male from an assumed locale and observing their offspring to determine if they look like we would expect.</description>

      <description>Pepita is a great 5th gen YBBB from our Papafee x Coco pairing. She only had 3 brothers, and at least one looked a lot like the Landy side of Coco&amp;rsquo;s lineage. Therefore, my expectation is that Pepita will throw Papafee or Landy looks. It will be a lot of fun to see what she does for us. She definitely resembles Coco more than Papafee&amp;rsquo;s dam, Sunny.&#xA;Pepita&#xA;Pepita1</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our fourth generation hold back, Papafee, and our little Ambilobe female from Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics, Coco. Coco is from a great pairing between Hendrix and Foxey. Hendrix brings a new WC Ambilobe line into the project and Foxey is from one of my favorite ybbb combinations from Kammerflage Kreations. Papafee is the HB male from our Zanaka x Sunny clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the fourth generation.</description>

      <description>Jimanga is one of our 5th gen Ambilobe breeders. He comes from our Manga x Imelda pairing, a great collab with Ramblin&amp;rsquo; Exotics. I can trace his personality all the way back to Kako. They teach you that chameleons are a look-but-don&amp;rsquo;t-touch pet, the hard way haha&amp;hellip; but what comes with that is an absolutely amazing defense display. Definitely something I really enjoy about these guys!&#xA;Jimanga&#xA;Jimanga1&#xA;Jimanga2</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our first captive hatched (CH) female, Bohana, and our male from Brian Stewart, Arti. Arti comes from some great Ambilobe lines from Colorado Chameleons and Kammerflage Kreations, and Bohana is a female Ambilobe hatched out by Busy B&amp;rsquo;s Exotics from a wild caught imported female. Bohana&amp;rsquo;s wild genes didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to add much to our project when combined with Arti, so we did not keep any of these animals.</description>

      <description>Mainty is one of the nicest RBBB females I could find for Ralph. Her sire, Bangheera, is a classic red body blue bar Ambilobe produced by Highlighter Chameleons and owned by Nature&amp;rsquo;s Van Gogh. After talking to Logan about Mainty&amp;rsquo;s brothers, it looks like many of them proved out to be similar to Grape Inferno or Bangheera, so although Moonclaw&amp;rsquo;s sire is Flamethrower, it seems she took after her dam sire.</description>

      <description>We raised two clutches of Furcifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons) under controlled conditions to answer a simple question:&#xA;How do the growth rates of babies raised under UVI 3 and UVI 6 compare?&#xA;Background Michael Nash recently studied two groups of Furcifer lateralis neonates and found that UVI 7 and UVI 3 resulted in no noticeable difference in growth rates for that species. He descibes his research in this post. This was an inspiring example of research in the hobby, and I would love to see more people get involved!</description>

      <description>Rye, for good luck.&#xA;We received 5 females from reputable CB sources that had issues during/after quarantine since 2017. The first 2 were in 2017. They never had great appetites and seemed to have respiratory issues. We brought them to the vet and kept them isolated for 60 days; however, the vet did not see anything wrong with them, and after they seemed to be healthy enough, we tried to breed them.</description>

      <description>tldr; Every animal you acquire, whether it be captive bred (CB) or wild caught (WC), should receive multiple fecal exams. A positive fecal should be managed in consultation with a qualified vet who has experience working with chameleons. Many different species of parasites do not shed at a constant rate, so a negative fecal is not a gaurantee that the animal is clean. We found Coccidia in 2 out of 25 exams that we performed in June-July 2021, and plan to run fecals on every animal in our possession and share the results/methods here.</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our third generation hold back, Nugget, and our gorgeous Ambilobe female from Chromatic Chameleons, Loko. Loko is from a great pairing between Kromatisk and Wet Dream - a ybbb x ybbb Ambilobe combination. Nugget is the HB male from our Jude x Kako clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the third generation. This was a great combination with our favorite third gen yellow male with an extremely high quality yellow female!</description>

      <description>This pairing was between our third generation hold back, Nugget, and our female from Brian Stewart, Amara. Amara proved out to carry a lot of her sire&amp;rsquo;s, Artemis&amp;rsquo;, traits like his dark blue bars and red highlighting. Nugget is the HB male from our Jude x Kako clutch. His yellows are my favorite from the third generation. This was a great combination of colorful ybbb with both blue bars and clean yellows!</description>

      <description>Kosma is Kosmo&amp;rsquo;s sister. Kosmo is one of my favorite RBBB Ambilobe produced over the past few years. He was sold as an egg by Eric Thompson, purchased as a juvenile by LA Chams and then we acquired him and his sister, Kosma, so we could have a solid RBBB Ambilobe project with two unrelated lines. However, because of their many homes, their lineage information was not very well maintained.</description>

      <description>We added Zanaka (F2) to our project because he is the product of one of Kammerflage Kreations&amp;rsquo;s top yellow-bodied Ambilobe, Promise Keeper, and a classic WC Ambilobe, Fanitso. We paired him with both of our main 3rd gen lines from Jude with the goal of producing something a bit different and adding new blood to the project. Papafee is our keeper from this group.&#xA;Zanaka x Sunny F3&#xA;Hatch dates 7/17/2020 - 7/28/2020 Hatch rate 28/29 F1</description>

      <description>Enclosure I tend to use indoor 24&amp;quot;x24&amp;quot;x48&amp;quot; screen enclosures for males, and 18&amp;quot;x18&amp;quot;x36&amp;quot; screen enclosures for females. I add horizontal and vertical boards to the frame which can support 3 levels of horizontal perching branches as well as hold up plants. In the base of the enclosure, I put 12&amp;quot; of bioactive space with drainage, soil barrier, abg mix, spag moss and leaf litter. For microfauna, I use springtails and isopods some red wrigglers and lesser mealworms.</description>

      <description>We get a lot of questions about caring for a panther chameleon, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d provide an organized response. Here is our strategy for hatchling, baby, juvenile, adult male and adult female Furcifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons).&#xA;Term Age (months) Hatchling 0 - 1 Baby 1 - 4 Juvenile 4 - 8 Adult 8+ Hatchlings We find that it is advantageous to house hatchlings in bio-active tubs because their food items are so small - and would escape screen enclosures - and some hatchlings like to tuck under the leaves near the soil (ABG mix) while digesting their remaining yolk.</description>

However, as he aged, oranges started to creep into his body from his gular and his tail turned a vibrant red.

It was almost as if other males didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, but when he saw a female, he would light up and start bobbing like a mad man. He was a phenomenal animal to work with, but he had a lot more red in his bars than what our long-term project goals are.</description>

      <description>Alla is our most successful female breeder to date. She has a gregarious personality and brings some of the nicest YBBB Kammerflage Kreations lineage into our project via her sire, JJ. We were very lucky to pick her up from Panther Creek Chameleons back in 2017 before JJ was sold to Chromatic Chameleons.&#xA;Alla&#xA;Alla1&#xA;Alla2&#xA;Filial F8-CG11 Sire JJ Dam Blue Bird&amp;rsquo;s Daughter 5 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Alla Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>Kako was one of the two females we paired with our second generation breeder - Jude. We purchased her from RB Barto, but she was produced by Bobby Ruddock. Her line is one of our favorite yellow body blue bar (YBBB) Ambilobe lines in the USA. Vibrant yellows and clean blue bars.&#xA;Kako&#xA;Kako1&#xA;Filial Group F2 Sire Sparkles Dam Leo&amp;rsquo;s Daughter 4 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Kako (F2) Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>This was our first clutch. Both parents, Flash and Judy, were sourced from Bruce Galbraith at Chameleon&amp;rsquo;s Paradise. Our hatch rate was ~50% and 4 of the babies did not make it to the 3 month mark. That was the baseline that we have tried to improve upon. For this clutch, we had used a standard calcium w/ multivitamin twice a month for most of Judy&amp;rsquo;s life, and we raised the babies in what I would call &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; baby bins (not fully-planted, bioactive bins like we use today).</description>

      <description>Jude was the alpha male from Flash and Judy&amp;rsquo;s clutch, hatched 10/17/17. He has strong yellows and a fierce attitude! We were lucky to select a male that looks a lot like his grandfather, Cowboy. He has now sired the majority of our babies and we will breed him sparingly moving forward.&#xA;Body shot&#xA;Dsc00380&#xA;Dsc00383&#xA;Jude&#xA;Jude2&#xA;Filial Group F2 Sire Flash Dam Judy 4 Generation Tree&#xA;Ancestral Report for Jude (F2) Generation 1 1.</description>

      <description>Female Fucifer pardalis (Panther Chameleons) will rock back and forth with their mouth agape in a defensive posture when they are not ready to mate.&#xA;It is always good to introduce the female into the male&amp;rsquo;s enclosure to avoid injury to either animal because their body language is not for show. Males are often too persistent for their own good. In the beginning of March, Judy climbed willingly into Flash&amp;rsquo;s cage, but we had to try multiple times before she was confortable.</description>

      <description>Charles Yamaguchi Charles Yamaguchi isn&amp;rsquo;t a real person. Elizabeth Lawrence scammed people under this persona selling a bunch of Ambilobe x Nosy Be crosses to people. Her other aliases include: Cami Garden Hat, April Wilcox, Trevor Neufeld, and April Michelle. I would never add a female from this lineage, but I found a great looking male that&amp;rsquo;s a few gens removed from her scam. So the male has proven out, but I will definitely want to run a locale genetic test to confirm the locale of these.</description>

      <description>Flash was our first generation breeder from Cowboy (CH) at Chameleon&amp;rsquo;s Paradise. He had a very gentle personality and only gave us one healthy clutch with Judy, from which we kept Jude. We were still learning when we got Flash and he passed after consuming a large number of wild bugs when pesticides had been applied to the lawn behind ours. The vet said that he had kidney failure like he&amp;rsquo;d been poisoned, but we have been continuing to improve our husbandry year-after-year in his honor.</description>

      <description>We have a small breeding group of &amp;lsquo;18 and &amp;lsquo;19 Pituophis deppei jani (Northern Mexican Pine Snakes). They are a beautiful big-bodied Pituophis species that start out &amp;ldquo;ugly,&amp;rdquo; brown and tan. They are highly variable, and as they age, their colors become more distinct. Many animals develop an orange head and tail. Their back saddle markings wash out in the middle and are crisp near the extremities. They can grow to be up to 9&amp;rsquo; long and are thicker than most colubrids.</description>
